Good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
We are open to everyone . Guests and locals alike .
Can our 2 children come in to listen to the music for a moment .
How old are they madam .
Tom is 12 and Elizabeth is 8 .
I'm afraid not madam .
Our licensing laws are quite strict .
Nobody under 18 years of age is allowed in a bar .
Well , it's the same at home but we thought since they're on holiday . It won't be any harm .
We won't order them anything strong .
Maybe they will just dance a bit .
It's our last night in China .
I'm really Sorry , I'd like to oblige . But you see my difficulty .
Maybe no one will notice .
Well , it's also our duty to check madam .
Now how about a drink in the lounge outside .
If you sit here , you can see the band and hear the music as well .
But no dancing .
Regretfully not .
Well , you're only doing your duty .
Yes , it's a hotel policy sir .
Now I'll make you 2 non-alcoholic drinks that look like the real thing . How about that .
That's great .
Can I have some grapes .
And lots of other fruit on top for me .
No problem .
What can I offer you and your wife , sir .

Pretty good .
I'm so glad to hear that .
What would you like to try tonight .
Your usual Irish whisky John Jameson .
Exactly . And on the Rocks I simply want to see if ICE will spoil the taste .
It must be a special day for you Mr. Bush , am I right .
You're right I always stick to my usual while today , I feel really good . Because one of your staff found my lost camera and sent it back to me , which I've never imagined before at all .
Nice to hear your high praise of our staff .
That's why I am so happy anything else special here .
I do want to give it a try .

I'll take that .
What would you like to drink , sir .
I'll have the usual beer , I suppose .
Fine one special cocktail and one non-alcoholic cocktail for the lady and one beer .
Could we have some snacks .
Certainly . I'll get a fresh supply .
Good evening , sir .
Would you like to order some wine with your meal .
Yes .
The wine list , sir .
Thank you .
You certainly have a very extensive cellar .
What would you recommend .
I think that a Chablis or a Muscatel would go very well with your oysters .
We'd like one , which is very dry .
Then I would recommend the Muscatel .
Fine , we'll take a half-bottle of that then .
And with your steak .
Let's see , do you have a very full bodied wine , which is not too fruity .
Our own House Wine which we import specially the Chateau de Lescours would be very suitable .
It is a Burgundy with a rich but delicate body which is not too dry .
That sounds just right .
We'll have a full bottle of that .
Certainly , sir .
Just a moment please .
Good evening , sir .
Are you expecting anyone .
No , just me .

Certainly without ice ice will spoil the taste .

When .

Rather long and tiring but a good night's sleep , will soon put me right again .
Well , welcome to the elite hotel .
Come in for a night cap . We'll have some music then .

We are also happy to see you , sir .
By the way , do you speak Japanese .
No I don't .
But why .
The town is nice . All right , but I can hardly see any Japanese visitors .
I have been here for almost a week but haven't heard a single word of Japanese spoken .
I see .
But you speak excellent ENGLISH that's unusual .
Thanks .
I'm so glad to hear that .
But good English cannot cure home sickness .
Are you kidding .
Homesickness .
It's unbelievable .
No kidding at all .
Now how about the other half .
The Japanese beer will surely wash away your homesickness .
Good idea .

I'll go to the kitchen and report it to the chef .
It's of no use at all . I've not enough time to wait for it .
I'm terribly Sorry Do you mind trying something else .
Then bring me a steak .
Remember to have it . Well done . This time , I don't have extra time to change this and that .
I'm sure we'll satisfy you .
Better this time .
Thank you .
Please try the shrimp this time .
Why I've canceled it , but still . I'll try .
Yes , this is good .
The chef said this is well done and the above one is medium .
But in fact they were the same shrimp today .
And he also asked me to tell you it was on the house .
Thank you very much .
I feel sorry for the words I've just said .
Not at all .
Good evening , sir .
How did you like the meal .
Oh it won't do at all .
I'm sorry to hear THAT . What's the problem . Sir .
First , it took us too long to wait for our courses to be served .
I'm sorry , sir , we're terribly busy , but we'll try to improve it next time .
And the chicken was overdone . It was as tough as leather .
I'm awfully sorry , I'll get you another one . If you'd like that would be on the house . Of course .
No , I don't want it any more .
Then we won't charge you anything for the chicken . Please accept our apologies .
That's all right .
I assure you that we'll try our best to improve our work and everything will be all right again next time you come .
All right . I think I'll come again .
You're always welcome .
Good evening , sir . Is everything to your satisfaction .
Oh yes it is wonderful .
Your service is excellent and I enjoyed the dinner , very much .
We're pleased that you like it , but is there anything in the dishes that we should improve .
You're doing very well , all the food was delicious except that there was too much salt in the soup .
I am so sorry for the soup , I'll take it to the kitchen and get you another one . If you'd like .
Oh . NO : It doesn't matter much .
Then the restaurant will offer you some fruit it's Free of Charge . Please accept our apologies .
That's very kind of you to do so .
You're welcome . Hope you'll come again .
We will .

How is it made .
The preparation is a bit complicated .
Let me give you just a brief introduction .
First ducks must be split open dressed scalded and dried .
When roasting . It's better to use fruit tree branches as firewood to lend more flavor to the duck .
Besides a steady temperature must be maintained in the oven and ducks must be rotated so that they can be evenly roasted .
How long does it take to roast the Ducks .
About 50 minutes .
And when the skin turns crisp and golden brown the duck is done .
How interesting it is .
We'll invite more friends to taste the dish next time .

I'll try chopsticks . But I'm afraid if I use them all the way through . I'll go back to the hotel with a half-empty stomach .

Good evening madam and Sir .
Good evening .
Please be Seated here is the Menu : Would you please order now .
Well , I've heard so much about the famous Beijing duck and I've been wanting to taste it for a long time .
You are Right There it would be a shame to leave Beijing without trying Peking roast duck .
It's Beijing's most famous dish and its taste is unique .
Can you tell us something about it .
Okay . Now , I'll give some ideas about how it became a popular dish how it is prepared .
And most important of all , how it is served .
Right .
The recipe of roasting ducks was first developed by a chef who prepared food for a Ming emperor .
Later it was made known to common folks by old chefs dismissed from the Royal Ming kitchen .
A man named Yan Quanren came to Beijing and began selling cooked ducks and eventually opened a duck restaurant outside Qianmen gate and named it Quanjude .
After further improvement of the way of roasting ducks his ducks became all the more tasteful and of course his restaurant soon earned its fame .
No wonder it is so well known .
Now let's come to the process of roasting ducks .
First ducks must be cut open dressed and scalded and dried .
When roasting . It's better to use fruit tree branches as firewood to lend flavor to the duck .
Amazing .
Besides regular temperature is a must to make it roasted evenly .
But how on earth is it eaten .
I'll be watering if I wait any longer .
The simple procedure is as follows . First you pick up a pancake and then dip duck pieces into the sweet soybean paste placed in front of YOU then you place them with stalks of raw scallion which should be placed in the center of the pancake Finally roll it up for convenience's sake .
It is excellent .
Well , eating is Believing the taste of the roast duck is in the eating .
Try and judge for yourself .
Good evening .
May I get you something to drink while you study the menu .
Yes , please . We'd like to try some Chinese beer .
What brand do you recommend .
Blue Sword is very popular .
We'll Take 5 Blue Sword beers , please .
Yes , sir . Are you ready to order .
Okay . We are interested in the sauteed Paddy chicken with green and red pepper is it hot .
Yes , sir . It's quite hot .
Let's try it . What is the Sichuan drunken chicken .
It is chicken cooked in rice wine .
Is it hot .
No it's not hot .
That's all right , we'll take one , and we also want the diced chicken with dried red pepper .
Very well .
We'd like a pork dish too : What do you suggest .
Most guests like the sweet and sour pork .
We all have tasted it . I think we'll take the deep fried suckling pig .
Okay .
Would you care for soup .
Where are the soups listed .
On the next page , sir .
We'll take the Sichuan hot and sour soup .
By the way , have we ordered enough for 5 people .
You might want to order 2 more dishes perhaps beef seafood or .

Thank you very much .
Do you like to have another piece of fried steak .

Do you have lots of money .

Congratulations .
So I'll treat you .
Let's go .
It's very kind of you to invite me .
I'm glad you could come Mr. White .
Will you take a seat at the head of the table .
Thank you .
This is my first time to come to a Chinese restaurant .
Could you tell me the different features of Chinese food .
Generally speaking , Guangdong food is a bit light Shanghai Food is rather oily and Hunan dishes are very spicy , having a strong and hot taste .
Chinese dishes are exquisitely prepared delicious and very palatable .
They're good in color flavor and taste .
Did you enjoy the meal .
It's the most delicious dinner . I have had for a long time .
I'm so glad you like it .
Thank you very much for your hospitality .
How come you eat so little .
I'm on a diet . I gained a few pounds this summer .
I have to watch my weight , too .
But my principle is eat now diet tomorrow .
Help yourself to whatever you like , please .
Thank you . I've been helping myself .
Would you have some more fish .
There's plenty left for me .
It's really tasty and so tender .
I'll introduce the food to you .
It's named sweat and sour fish .
You know , Chinese food is very popular in America .
But most of my fellow countrymen don't know that the Chinese food they like so much is not nearly as good as the real Chinese food here .
Yeah , that's true .
You may call that American Chinese food .
Won't you have some more .
It's getting rather late .
I'm afraid I must go now .
Can you stay a little longer .
No , thanks .
Today's food is very delicious . Thank you for treating me .
This is the famous liquor in my country . So I would urge you to drink a cup .
Oh it's 60 proof , very strong .
So please drink it slowly .
Now let's drink to our meeting .
Bottom up .
Look at the long line outside .
This is the best Chinese restaurant in town .
It can't be that good .
Just wait till you taste their food .
What do you usually have for lunch .
Hamburger or sandwich .
What a beautiful restaurant .
It's like a trip to China .
The decorations are exotic .
The Chinese always use a lot of red .
I wonder if it has any cultural meaning .
Probably .
This seafood dish is so Delicious it tastes like shrimp and some kind of fruit , what's in it .
You're right it's shrimp and the fruit is pineapple .
How do you like the sweet and sour fish .
It's real gourmet food really melts in your mouth .
Here we've finished this side of the fish . So let me turn it over .
Wait . Second , Tom , it's bad luck to turn the fish over .
We have a superstition here that if you turn the fish over . Maybe the next boat or airplane you're on will turn over too .
Well , I don't think I want that to happen . Thanks for telling me .
So do you gentlemen follow any sports .
Yes .
Howard and I watched a couple of basketball games from America last week .
Michael Jordan is really unbelievable .
He's a very skillful player and a clever businessman too .
He must make much money on those tennis shoe endorsements he does .
Right and I hope we can do the same with our latest line of sports equipment by we way , can you tell me what the latest news is on our tennis rackets .
We've made some modifications to the handle , so it's easier to hold on to .
We've also designed a whole new look for the racket .
These new rackets are going to be top of the line .
I believe the new look will make the customers notice them more , and the high quality will keep them happy .
Maybe we can get Jimmy Connors to endorse them .
That would be great . But let's not get carried away .
When will I see the rackets .
We are going to the factory tomorrow Morning you'll see them and a few other products .
Let's drink a toast to the new rackets . Bottoms up .
Have one more fish ball Mr. Bowen .
No , thanks .
It's great , but I'm afraid I have to watch my weight .
Mr. Dewey .
I wish I could have more , but I'm really full .
Thank you .
Then have some Hami melon .
Please help yourselves .
It tastes great .
It's the best melon in China .
How about importing some to the states .
A good idea .
Well , thank you so much for this wonderful evening . Mr. Li .
I've enjoyed every dish and every minute of our table talk .
And I'm sure Guy feels the same way .
Yes I do .
I'm glad to hear that .
Tomorrow , Mr. Yang will take you to the Tiananmen Gate and I hope you both have a good time there .
I'm sure we WILL . Thank you .
I'll see you again for the negotiation . The day after tomorrow , right .
Yes .
So . See you then . Good bye .
Good bye .
Here comes Peking duck .
It looks very tasty doesn't it .
But , but how are we going to eat it I wonder .
How are we going to eat it .
We shall have it together with the condiments , you see on the table and pancakes fried in Duck grease .
What I mean is , are we going to do it with chopsticks .
Yes , if you like , but we can ask them for a knife and fork . If you prefer it .
No , I don't think it would be necessary .
I practiced eating with chopsticks for weeks before taking this trip . And now I can handle them in a way so that I wouldn't be starved to death when I travel about in China .
That's good .
Surely this big roast duck has to be carved before we eat it but how could the carving be done with chopsticks instead of a knife .
Well .
I thought we were going to have Peking duck for dinner .
Isn't that what you told me this afternoon Madame Tang .
Yes . Didn't you see the roast duck just now .
But why is it taken away .
It has to be sliced before it's served otherwise it would be impossible to eat it with chopsticks .
Oh I see .
The carving is done in the kitchen and not on the dining table as in the West .
As far as I know knives don't appear on the dining table in Asian countries as a rule .
Perhaps people in the East . Think it's barbarous or uncivilized of the Westerners to eat with knives and forks .
No , I don't call it barbarous or uncivilized .
Every nation has its own civilization and it would be wise of us all to respect one another's customs and way of life .
I agree with you entirely there .
Incomprehensible .
Being a guest in China . I drink Maotai as the Chinese do .
Yes , just as the English proverb goes , When in Rome do as the Romans do .
If I ever have the opportunity to go to Revivia . I'll certainly do as the Revivians do .
You would be most welcome there , Mr. Chen and you as well . Madame Tang .
At the beginning of the dinner , both of you toasted me to show welcome and now I would like to reply to your toasts .
To the success of your future visits to Revivia .
To the success of your China trip .
To Sino-Revivian trade .
Could you bring me the bill . Please .
Okay .
Do I pay you or the cashier .
Cashier , please .
May I have . The bill , please .
Separate or together .
Just ONE and give it to me .
How much do we owe you .
$36 .
Is it correct .
Yes , sir .
I'll pay you $30 here now .
Thank you . Your change sir .
This is for you .
Thank you . Please come again .
Serving guests at a coffee shop .

I'm sure you'll like it .
That sounds good .
We'll take it .
Then , how much would you like to spend for each table .
At about 2000 yuan and make the dishes typically Cantonese .
Besides this banquet is given in honor of Mr. Murphy , who has a good sense of humor .
I think we need to prepare something special for him .

How about lobster invites shrimps .
Great .
But call it shrimps invite lobster .
It will be perfect for our welcome banquet .

And how about drinks .
Please prepare some Great Wall dry white wine Qingdao I lager , beer champagne coconut milk and pineapple juice .

Okay .
So let me repeat what you've told me a welcome banquet in the Palm Beach Hall at 7 tomorrow evening 5 tables for 52 at 2000 yuan a table drinks and fruit a special dish shrimps invite lobster for each table .
Is that correct . Mr. Stone .
Yes , that's correct .
Thank you Mr. Stone .
We'll get everything ready before the banquet .
I hope you'll enjoy it .
Thank you very much .
Thank you very much .
Goodbye .
Come in , please . The door is open .
Are you still in bed .
Sorry to wake you up .
I was wondering , you want to go to the supermarket .
Our refrigerator is empty and My stomach's growling .
I'm hungry , too .
Wait a few minutes and I'll be right with you .
Let's get a shopping cart .
First , we'll get our vegetables .
Do you want , white , red or Chinese cabbage .
They also have asparagus cauliflower carrots radishes broccoli corn cucumbers and eggplant .
Let's get some lettuce tomatoes and cucumbers for salad and some of these spices garlic parsley ginger and green onions for seasoning .
Do we need some soy sauce and vinegar .
No .
Here are mushrooms squash sweet potatoes and potatoes straight from the farm .
Let's check out the fruit section .
I'd like some grapefruit watermelons and peaches .
But they don't look quite ripe yet .
Look at the fresh cranberries .
Actually , I prefer canned cranberry sauce . I'm crazy about American grapes either the green ones or red ones .
And look nice fresh Cherries .
There are ripe and soft .
By the way the plums and pineapples look good too .
I should never shop when I'm Hungry I buy too much .
Let's go to the meat section .
Want some beef .
Yes .
We can have some ground up for Meat Loaf and hamburger .
Steaks are too expensive for our budget .
Just as you say .
Or let's have something other than beef today .
The experience I had last time with the burned stew meat is still stuck in my mind .
Here are pork chops ham , bacon , sausage and TV dinners .
Forget the TV dinners .
Don't you see any spare ribs .
Here they are , but they don't look good today .
This veal looks nice though , it reminds me of lean pork .
I wonder how they eat fatback what about getting some mutton for stew .
That's a good idea .
Do you also want a leg of lamb or lamb chops .
Yes chops .
Where is the poultry .
I don't see any .
Right in front of your EYES . I want some chicken livers and giblets .
Why is duck more expensive than chicken .
Ducks are not as popular so few farmers raise them .
It also costs more to grow a duck to the same weight than it does a chicken .
Turkey reminds me of cranberry sauce .
They go together .
Turkey reminds me of Thanksgiving .
Here is the fish counter look at the lobster and crabs .
Shall we get some shrimp and prawns .
I'm allergic to these things , sorry .
Let's go over there and get some milk . A couple of dozen eggs and some orange juice .
Fresh or frozen .
The frozen concentrate in cans is really good .
Let's get frozen juice .
Will you get some chocolate ice cream for dessert and some ice cream bars or Popsicles for snacks .
Do we need any jelly .
Actually , what is the difference between jam and jelly .
When they make jelly the juice is squeezed from the pulp through filters and then processed jam contains the whole fruit which is mashed and processed .
Pickles .
Pickles are cucumbers preserved in vinegar .
We've more than enough .
Let's go over to the checkout stand .
For many 3rd world countries tea is a convenient cash crop and an important export .
The world's biggest tea producers are India , China and Sri Lanka , but other countries such as Kenya and Malawi are fast gaining in importance .
Here at Sir John Lyon House in the City of London teas are tasted and examined and checked for flavor and quality .
I'm going to talk to one of the men in charge of this .
Tell me what exactly do you do to taste tea .
Well , basically it's a question of comparison between one cup and another to assess it for its flavor and its strength and for its keeping quality and our daily routine is to do exactly that .
The tea has to be weighed in a precise measurement into each cup and the liquor is then infused for 6 minutes . In our case to make quite sure that all the flavor is available in that tea comes out .
And the taster then compares some tea against another , so that you can see whether their performance is better or worse than previously and you also have another standard for valuation purposes so that you know on any given week whether the market has gone up or down and therefore , whether you should increase or diminish your valuation .
Are there really big differences between teas from different parts of the world .
Yes , very considerable differences , not only from countries of origin . But between individual teas , from the same estate made on different days . And I think this is one of the interesting facets of tea in that you can't sell as a commodity in bulk .
It has to be sold in small parcels because each individual day's manufacture can taste different from the previous day's .
I think that the climate plays probably the largest part here and the tea for example that grows at 6,000 or 7,000 feet in equatorial Africa or in Ceylon produces a certain flavor , possibly because of the coolness of the climate or the elevation itself , which is not available in tea , which is grown in a lower-elevation , but .
In addition , tea , which is grown during wet weather and is growing fast produces less attractive character and flavor than the tea that is growing very slowly in dry conditions and this applies really throughout the tea-growing world .
What part of the Bush do you use .
You take the most succulent part which is the shoot at the top . The Bud and the leaves on either side of it and these pluck very easily . They're very brittle and very juicy and this produces the best flavor .
Those people who have less stringent rules about plucking will go lower into the bush and they will diminish the quality of the tea . As a result .
What happens to the tea . Once it's been plucked .
When it has been plucked , it is then processed in a tea factory .
The tea is reduced from being a green brittle Leaf and it is put through various machines which reduce its Size it is then fired in a tea dryer and then sorted and the finished product is what people see in their packet , a small brittle fragment .
Which has just been dried .
Which has been fired .
Yes , it's as if it's been put in an oven .
It is in fact a type of oven that fires it and this reduces the moisture content down to a very low level , so that the tea then keeps its freshness and it will liquor again quickly when infused with water .
What will you have for lunch today .
As usual , McDonald's Kentucky Fried Chicken or some pizzas , whatever .
Why don't we try some Chinese fast food for a change .
Good idea .
I like boxed rice noodles dumplings .
But even the nearest Chinese restaurant is far away from here .
We only have one hour . You know .
We can take a taxi that doesn't cost much .
Okay .
You are my boss .
What's up Mary .
Mom is out : Can you come over and cook for me .
No problem .
I'll make you the best meal you've ever tasted .
Great .
What Color's your new dress .

It's the same color it's green too .
That is a lovely hat .
Can I bring you another drink . Bob .
No , thanks .
As a matter of fact I must be leaving now .
You know I have some work to catch up on .
Must you leave so early .
Can you stay a little longer .
I'm sorry but I'm afraid that it can't wait . I'll visit you another day .
This cake tastes terrible .
I'm sorry .
Let me get you something else to eat .
Well , it's not too bad but you may have too much flour .
I don't think so . I'm sure I used 2 cups .
Well , perhaps you left it in the oven for too long .
Yes , I might have .
Shall I make some coffee .
That's a good idea .
It's ready . Do you want any milk .
Just a little please .
What about some sugar .
2 teaspoons .
No less than that .
One.5 teaspoons please .
That's enough for me .
How about a break .
Good idea coffee .
Yes . I'd like some .
Just a Minute , I'll see to it right away .
Excuse me please pass the salt .

I wish I knew how to make it .
It's my first barbecue .
It tastes great .
How is it cooked .
Let me show you .
I hope that won't cause you too much trouble .
No trouble at all .
I still have some raw beef left .
Look here first drive this stick through the beef .
Then place it about 4 inches above the heat .
Wait for 5 minutes then turn and roast the other side for 4 minutes .
Now , turn the beef again .
During this period cover it with barbecue sauce . A couple of times .
Now it's done .
It looks so inviting .
Then have some more .
Thanks .
The sauce also tastes marvelous .
I made it myself .

Look , I have milk and 3 lumps of sugar in my cup of tea and I never put on weight .
We drink green tea instead of black tea in China and never add milk or sugar .
Green tea .
Don't breathe a word of it to Mrs. West or she would be rushing over to Chinatown , to get it . Specially for you .
I know you wouldn't want her to do that .
Of course not .
Thank you for reminding me .
Sandwich .
These are tomato sandwiches and those are cucumber ones .
Thanks .
But how about yourself .
I'm going to slice this loaf .
I like bread and butter .
Pass me the butter will you .
Here you are .
And here is jam for you since you keep slim , no matter what you eat .
Lucky girl .
Thanks . I had a letter from my Pa and Ma this morning .
They have just got home from a trip to Asia .
I wish I could afford a trip to China to see the Great Wall .
Well , where there is a will there is a way .
I'm sure I'll be listening to a famous professor Becky Brown's lectures on Shakespeare in a Chinese college one of those days .
It's sweet of you to say so , but that could only be my daydream .
Oh Where's my handbag .
I must have left it in the dining room .
Come back Becky .
Look .
You have been sitting on it all the time .
Tell me , do you have any other name beside Becky .
No . I've been called Becky ever since I was a kid .
Why did you ask .
Oh you remind me of somebody that's all .
For lunch today , we'll be having 3 guests .
What shall I make .
Roast pork boiled potatoes fried mushrooms sweet & sour fish slices and Ham & winter melon soup .
Okay . What kind of dessert shall I prepare .
White Honey Soup .
What time shall lunch be set .
12-30 please .
Can you make the tea .
Yes , of course , I can .
Is there any water in this kettle .
Yes there is .
Where's the tea dear .
It's over there behind the teapot .
What shall I buy for today's menu .
I want a green salad for lunch for supper . I want some meat .
What kind of meat , ma'am .
I think beef will do .
How much beefsteak do you want .
About £3 .
Do we have enough bread and potatoes .
Yes we do .
How come you eat so little .
I'm on a Diet . I gained a few pounds this summer .
I have to watch my weight , too .
But my principle is eat now diet tomorrow .
Good morning .
Morning , Mr. Sun .
I hope you had a good night's rest .
Yes , thanks .
I slept like a log .
That's because you have a quiet room facing the back garden , instead of one facing the noisy street like mine .
Would you like some fruit juice .
No thank you .
I'm not used to cold drinks in the morning .
How about cereals then .
Cereals .
Yes , please .
The cereal boxes are on the sideboard just help yourself , will you .
Pass the milk jug to Mr. Sun Becky dear .
And here is the sugar basin will you pass it along , too .
What do you have for breakfast in China , sonny boy .
In north China , we have steamed bread and porridge together with settled vegetables .
Sometimes we have fried cakes washed down with bean curd soup .
I see .
We can ask Sarah to make porridge for you if you like .
Both Becky and Jack hate it so .
Please don't cook anything specially for me .
I'll just have things usually served here .
That's very considerate of you .
We often have eggs for breakfast .
Sometimes it's bacon .
The prices for all kinds of meat shot up again recently .
God knows why .
Not the prices again please .
It's boiled eggs this morning .
How would you like your eggs done every morning Mr. Sun .
Boiled fried poached scrambled or would you prefer omelets .
Oh , it's not fair . Mrs. West .
You've never asked Jack or me how we'd like our eggs done .
We are often served with hard boiled eggs when we prefer them half done .
You've been so heartless .
Oh .
Heartless , did you say .
Now none of your cheek my girl .
If you or Jack had come all the way from the other side of the Great Wall . I might have asked you too .
I wouldn't call the other side of the Atlantic , a place very near would you sunny boy .
I simply LOVE eggs .
So I like them no matter how they are done .
Look out . Mrs. West .
Someone is worming his way into your heart .
How could he . If I don't have one .
Didn't someone say I was heartless just now .
Good morning , sir .
A table for 2 .
That's right .
I'll show you to your Table this way please .
Please take a seat .
Is the seat taken please .
Sorry David , let me save him this seat he'll come right now .
Hello , Kevin . All of the tables are full can I join you .
Okay . Come here and sit at my table please .
What food . Did you have Kevin .
Look .
Fried fish mashed potato and coffee .
They all seem delicious .
Yes , they are all delicious .
We can drop in here for a quick lunch .
Let's get that table over there .
This is a cafeteria .
We have to serve ourselves .
Oh .
Just pick up a tray and move down that line .
Can I take anything I want .
Sure .
Where do we pay .
There's a cashier at the end of the line .
We'll pay her .
I see .
Excuse me is that seat taken .
No it isn't .
I'll move my things .
Thank you . I'm Daisy Daisy Smith .
I'm glad to meet you Daisy my name's Ellen Hill .
How do you think of the food of this cafeteria .
It's very good .
Food is of great variety and delicious .
Which would you prefer tea or coffee .
Coffee : please .
2 coffees .
Yes .
Certainly , sir .
Will there be anything else .
No , that's all . Thanks .
Thank you , sir .
This is the First time I've never eaten in a cafeteria .
I'm like a country girl in the big city . I don't know what to do .
I'll show you just follow suit .
Look at those people standing in the long line selecting the food from the counter .
Yes we should join the line too .
Come on . Ruth .
It's fun to try new foods and new ways .
You know , we usually stand in line to buy movie ticket but we never heard of standing in line waiting for food .
That's what you call a cultural difference .
Are those the food prices that are posted on the wall .
Yes . Food is less expensive in a cafeteria because you serve yourself .
How .
Just pick up a tray then put a knife , fork spoon and a paper napkin on it and start down the line .
How .
Tell the man behind the counter . What you want .
Fish , please .
You get 2 vegetables with it and some potatoes or rice whichever you want .
Okay . I like that vegetable but I don't know what to call it .
Just point to it if you don't know the name that one just happens to be asparagus .
All right , I'll have asparagus and some of that .
And what kind of salad . Do you like .
A friend told me I should try a Waldorf salad that's this one with apples raisins nuts and mayonnaise , isn't it .
Yes , now pick up a dessert .
There is a jelly fruit ice cream .
Say no more . I want that fresh strawberry pie with Whipped Cream That's my favorite .
What are you going to have .
Black walnut ice cream .
Do you want coffee , tea or milk .
Let's see , I'll take milk .
Okay .
Just pick up a glass and set it on the machine and push it against the lever .
That's fun , how am I doing .
Great .
Now we just pay the cashier at the end of the line and then find ourselves a table .
Okay . This will be my treat .
Oh no you don't .
All right , then we'll go Dutch .
Next time this time you're my guest .
My it's nice to lunch with such a prosperous gentleman .
Thank you .
It's crowded .
Look one empty small table by that big picture window over there , let's go and get it .
This is a pretty spot .
You can see the people passing by . While you eat .
And they can see you eat while they pass and that's a pretty picture , too .
You coin a neat phrase .
It's true .
Is this the only type of place for lunch .
There are some lunch counters but they serve only a few specialties .
Why can't you eat lunch in a restaurant .
Well you can but the service isn't as fast .
Most people only have a half an hour to one hour for lunch .
This time is too short for them to eat in a restaurant or to run back and forth from home to school or office because the cities are too big .
So they eat quickly at the lunch counters .
Right .
Lunch is normally a light meal anyway .
Workers must either take lunch with them or get it near the place where they work .
What about the children .
Kids in school take sandwiches fruit and cookies along with them or eat in school cafeterias .
This is delicious .
If all the food tastes as good as this . I won't miss our own food too much .
I like American food .
I'm glad you enjoy it .
Are you done .
I'm full .
Are you sure .
You can get seconds .
I'm positively Full I have no more room .
Thank you very much .
Don't mention it .
Oh , there are so many people here .
Yes , because the price is lower and the speed is quick many people love to come here .
What shall we do first .
Keep the line with a tray put a knife a fork and a piece of paper napkin on it .
How do we order .
Look .
All the price of food and name are on the wall .
Well let's join the line along the counter together .
Oh , it's so crowded here .
Yes . People like to eat at a cafeteria . It's cheaper and quicker than other restaurants .
What shall we do now .
Just pick up a tray put a knife a fork . A spoon and a paper napkin on it and keep the line .
I see .
Are those the food prices that are posted on the wall .
Yes , you can choose whichever you want .
What a variety .
Meat , fried fish , meat rolls they all sound delicious and make my mouth water .
Yes , What are you going to have .
I'd like the fried fish .
Okay . Let's join in the line along the counter .

I'm very sorry to have spoilt your evening .
Until which date are you staying sir .

There're too much salt in this dis .
Sorry , the beef is overdone . What I want is the rare one .
The meat is raw .
I told you I want medium .
The fish isn't fresh at all .
Can't you see my gesture of calling .
How much longer are we going to have to wait for our dinner .
I think you've made a mistake .
I've been trying to catch your attention now for the last 15 minutes .
No taste at all . It is just like dish water .
Oh . No. this soup is almost cold .
Oh no , this won't do at all .
The fish is badly cooked .
The sun's shining straight into my eyes .
Is it possible to change tables .
There's too much salt in the meat .
This coffee's too strong .
This mandarin fish tastes , as if it were caught a year ago .
This meat's as tough as leather .
I told you I wanted it . Well done .
We can't see the band from here . Could we change tables .
Well the chicken's overdone .
You've been ignoring us all evening .
I can offer you some oyster soup compliments of the chef .
I'll get you another one .
I'll have them made you another one .
I'll let you know when one's free .
I'll speak to the chef and see what he can do .
I'm afraid all the tables by the windows are taken .
I'm afraid chicken takes quite a while to prepare .
I can give you something else . If you'd like .
I'm sorry , sir , we're terribly busy .
I'm sorry , sir . We're very short of help .
I'm terribly sorry , sir .
Would you like it cooked a little more .
It's warmer here .
Perhaps you would prefer to eat in the middle of the room .
There's less draft .
What's the problem . Ma'am .
Would you like me to send it back .
Would you like something else . While you're waiting .
I'll return your chicken to the chef .
I'll check your order with the chef .
My apologies I must have misunderstood you .
Is there anything wrong with your order sir .
This isn't what I ordered .
I ordered the Smoked Salmon , not the fried carp .
Waiter this steak tastes like leather .
I'm very sorry for the mistake .
We are very sorry to have caused you this trouble .
Sorry , I got it wrong .
If it really bothers you I'll replace it for you .
Once it's served it's served .
Waiter my food is a long time coming .

It's on the house .
Is anything the matter sir .
Yes , it is my steak .
What's wrong with it . Sir .
It is too raw I wanted mine . Well done .
I'm sorry you didn't enjoy it sir .
I'll return it to the kitchen and bring you one that's well cooked .
Sorry for the trouble .
That's perfectly all right .
How is your steak this time .
It is done just right this time .
I'm glad you enjoy it .
I'm very upset at the way I have been treated .
Perhaps you could tell me what exactly is the matter .
I'm sure the waiters didn't mean to be rude .
Well , there is something else this wine here , I think it is corked .
But this one here is at most medium .
I've had enough .
You asked to see me . Mr. Smith .
You see , she just started out as a waitress . A week ago and doesn't understand English very well .
She should have changed your steak .
That's more like it .
Perhaps it is a little too sour for your taste .
This is not what I asked for , I'm afraid .
May I ask what you ordered again .
I've ordered a steak , not a fried chicken .
Waitress I ordered my meal at least 20 minutes ago and it hasn't come yet .
Why is it taking so long .
I'll check your order with the chef .
Please do it faster .
Is anything the matter sir .
Sorry for the trouble .
This chicken is a bit undercooked .
Excuse me , but could you bring me another fork please .
Could you bring me another beer .

Now there's a choice of vegetables asparagus or green peas , which would you prefer .
I believe I'll have mashed potatoes .
I think I'll start with a crabmeat salad and then half a dozen clams .
Please give me a ham sandwich .
A baked potato would be good .
Would it be possible to have an English muffin instead of toast .
I'll have my coffee later , but I would like a glass of milk with my meal .
Anything is all right with me .

Me too , if it's not too spicy .
I don't feel like eating much .

In fast food restaurants . However , no tip is necessary .
When you pay for your food , the clerk gives you a number and you wait at a table till your number is Called then you go to the counter to get it .

What kind of tea . Would you like .
Green tea .
It's mild and good for your health .
Tea .
Tea is the most universally used beverage It is prepared from the dried shoots of an evergreen shrub Thea sinensis a Camellia .
The main tea-producing areas are India China including Taiwan , Sri Lanka and Japan .
Kinds of tea .
High quality tea comes from the bud and the first 2 leaves of the growing shoot , although more mature leaves are used in some teas .
The quality of tea beverage is influenced by the climate where the tea plant is grown .
Teas also differ because of the way the leaves are treated before they are dried .
For green tea . The fresh leaves are heated or steamed to inactivate enzymes before they are rolled and dried .
For black tea the leaves are allowed to wither before they are rolled and Dried then they are held . A few hours before they are heated and dried .
During this holding period enzymes in the green leaf catalyze the oxidation of constituents , which results in changes in color taste and aroma .
Such tea is described as fermented although the changes are due mainly to oxidation .
Oolong tea is only partly fermented and a brew from oolong tea has some of the characteristics of both green and black tea .
Quality of the beverage .
Tea beverage of high quality is clear and bright .
A flavorful cup of tea has a quality known as Briskness , and a distinct but subtle aroma .
Some astringency is inherent in tea . But green tea is more astringent than black .
The strength of the beverage determines whether the taste of the tea is mild or robust .
Green tea is pale greenish yellow and the black tea is a deep amber color .
Constituents in tea .
Caffeine .
Tea beverage as with coffee is valued for the stimulating effect of the caffeine which it contains .
Tea leaves contain more caffeine than does roasted coffee . But the concentration in the beverage averages somewhat less in tea .
Values found in the Literature include 70 milligrams per cup of beverage and 28 milligrams , 44 milligrams and 47 milligrams per cup for black tea in bags steeped one-3 and 5 minutes respectively .
Comparable values given for loose black tea , were 31 milligrams , 38 milligrams and 40 milligrams per cup of beverage .
Green and Oolong tea beverages bagged or loose contained less caffeine than black tea .
Tea contains in addition to caffeine small amounts of 2 other methyl , xanthines Theobromine and theophylline 3 , 7 dimethyl and one-3 dimethyl xanthine respectively .
Phenolic constituents in green tea .
Tea leaves are extraordinarily rich sources of a group of compounds , known as polyphenolic substances which account for almost one 3rd of the weight of dried leaf .
The color of the beverage and much of its taste especially astringency is attributed to these polyphenolic compounds or to their oxidation products in black tea .
Green tea contains a number of flavonols with the basic structure specific flavonols found in tea include myricetin , quercetin and kaempferol and their glycosides .
Other phenolic compounds found in tea even greater concentration than the flavonols are the flavonols .
This group constitutes 80% of the total polyphenols in tea These include catechin and gallocatechin their esters with Gallic acid catechin gallate and gallocatechin gallate and their epimers .
The formulas for these phenolic compounds are Epigallocatechin gallate , is the main flavonol in dried green tea .
The catechins are responsible for the slightly astringent metallic taste of green tea beverage They are involved also in Browning and other types of discoloration in Foods of plant origin .
Another phenolic constituent is tea theogallin accounts for approximately 1% of the dry weight of the LEAF chlorogenic acid , also a phenolic compound is a minor constituent in tea .
Phenolic constituents in black tea .
More than 3-fourths of the polyphenolic constituents of tea may be extracted after the leaves are fermented .
In addition to those compounds found in green tea new ones appear in black tea .
Rolling the leaves prior to fermentation permits the polyphenolase enzyme to come in contact with the phenolic substrates and catalyze their oxidation .
Theaflavins , which are formed when flavonols are oxidized make up approximately 2% of the weight of dried Black tea alone . They are very astringent and the amount of caffeine in tea should make it very bitter .
It appears that theaflavins modify the bitterness of caffeine and caffeine , the astringency of theaflavins , giving the beverage its characteristic briskness .
A second group of substances which appear in fermented tea are the thearubigins the structures of which are still questioned .
These constitute from 7% to 20% of the weight of dried black tea .
The bright orange theaflavins give sparkle to tea and the rusty brown thearubigins depth to the color .
As fermentation proceeds , the thearubigins increase , and the theaflavins decrease .
The concentration of phenolic substances is greatest in the bud . And the first Leaf of the harvested tea shoot is progressively less in leaves 1 to 3 and is least in the stem .
A high phenolic content , gives a tea with a high color .
Tea leaves are separated into classes according to size and so marketed .
The terms Orange Pekoe pekoe and souchong denote progressively larger leaves of black tea .
The prefix broken inserted before each term indicates that the leaves are not intact smaller pieces of tea leaves are known as fannings and fragments which are finer still are designated dust These are used in tea bags .
Aroma .
The aroma of tea contributes to its appeal .
The volatile compounds responsible , have been referred to as essential oils .
Approximately 30 compounds have been identified in the aroma of green tea . The major ones being benzyl alcohol phenylethyl alcohol a hexenol linalool geraniol and methyl salicylate .
The aroma of black tea is more complex . More than 300 compounds are present , half of which have been identified and none of which alone gives a unique black tea aroma .
The breakdown of amino acids , which occurs as the flavonols are oxidized gives rise to aldehydes in black tea aroma .
Theanine the ethyl amide of glutamic acid is the main amino acid in the fresh-leaf and contributes 1% to 2% of the dried weight but other amino acids arise during the early part of the processing .
Trans 2 hexenal , formed from linolenic acid is major component of the aroma .
Other constituents are thought to come from the oxidation of carotenoids of the leaf .
Preparing tea beverages .
Desired soluble constituents , some of which are volatile are extracted from tea leaves by steeping the leaves in hot water .
The temperature of the water when it is in contact with the leaves is as important in making tea as it is in making coffee .
Water , which has just come to a rolling boil not boiled water , which makes flat tasting tea should be added at once to tea leaves in a preheated pot .
Unless the pot is very hot . The temperature of the water will drop too low during steeping for the best extraction .
A lid on the pot as the tea steeps helps prevent loss of heat and escape of steam and aroma from the beverage .
A steeping period of 5 minutes with water at 88° is required to give tea of the same strength as that steeped 3 minutes at a temperature of 93° .
Minimum temperature of the water when it is in contact with tea leaves is simmering and at this temperature , the time required to steep tea is 6 to 7 minutes .
Extracting caffeine from the tea leaves is not a problem because a high percentage of it is removed in 2 minutes by water at 85° .
Thearubigins are more readily extracted than theaflavins .
If water boils when it is in contact with tea leaves a high proportion of polyphenolic compounds are extracted these make the hot beverage excessively astringent .
The tea pot should be made of a material other than metal this is even more important for tea than for coffee because of the high proportion of polyphenolic substances in tea .
Coffee bars are popular meeting places for young people .
It is possible to dance in some bars but alcoholic drinks are not sold .
Although the correct name for the midday meal is lunch many English families call it dinner .
To complicate matters further , the mid-morning break of coffee and biscuits is also called lunch .
English people do not wish each other good appetite .
The English drink more tea than any other nation . £7.77 per year , or 4.67 cups daily per head .
In times of disaster or tragedy a nice cup of tea is offered as a kind of universal cure .
The hours during which English pubs are allowed to open are strictly controlled by the law .
Times vary in different parts of the country but are approximately from 11:00 AM to 2:30 PM and from 6:00 PM to 10:00 PM or 11:00 PM on weekdays and from 12 noon to 2:00 PM and from 7 to 10:30 PM on Sundays .
Beer , wine and spirits , as well as non-alcoholic drinks like lemonade can be bought at a pub , but it is rare to find one that sells coffee and tea .
At one time the only food available was sandwiches and meat pies but nowadays . The situation is much better with salads and hot meats served at the bars of many pubs .
Look outside for the signs Inn food and pub food .
It is normal to buy one's own drinks at the bar and the barman is not tipped unless he brings drinks to the table .
Each order is paid for separately and not at the end of the evening .
Inexpensive restaurants known as Fish and Chip shops' are something of a national institution in the UK .
Remaining open until about 11:00 PM they are ideal for the motorist on a long journey .
Fish and chips can be eaten in the restaurant or taken away wrapped in paper .
Foreign visitors to the UK are often surprised to see the large number of Chinese restaurants at least one in every town .
These restaurants offer good food at reasonable prices and are very popular .
If America is a pantry the American Kitchen is a laboratory .
It is equipped with a wealth of culinary machines and gadgets designed to simplify the task of preparing foods .
America's Obsession With laborsaving tools and mechanical devices was translated first into Apple peelers and ice cream freezers and later into space age ovens high speed blenders electric juicers and an extensive catalog of other implements that have greatly transformed the process of cooking .
The best known and most popular American foods are grilled steaks hamburgers fried chicken boiled lobster and fried fish .
All of these dishes can be delicious and none require much cooking skill .
Generally American cooking is unsophisticated and straightforward concerned with content rather than form .
It is as varied inventive and ultimately indefinable as America itself .

As the 20th century draws toward an end Coca Cola a little more than a century old itself stands out as the most successful product in the history of commerce .
People on every continent in almost every country of the world are familiar with the name and taste of this world famous soft drink .
Coca Cola was born in Atlanta on May 8 , 1886 when a pharmacist named Dr. John Stith Pemberton produced the syrup . According to legend in a brass pot in his Backyard when by accident or design carbonated water was added to the syrup . It produced a drink that was declared delicious and refreshing .
It was registered in the US Patent Office on January , 1893 .
Through clever advertising the demand for the product grew by leaps and bounds .
One great leap forward came in 1894 , when Joseph Biedenharn of Vicksburg Mississippi impressed with the demand for the drink at his soda fountain installed bottling machinery and began to sell cases of Coca-Cola to plantations and lumber camps up and down the Mississippi River .
Today the Coca-Cola bottling system is the largest most widespread production and distribution network in the world .
In 1916 the uniquely shaped bottle designed by a glass company in Terre Haute , Indiana was developed to protect Coca Cola from imitations .
In the 1920s Coca Cola pioneered in producing 6 packs cardboard cartons that held 6 bottles of the drink .
In 1929 a distinctively shaped fountain glass became standard and helped to advertise the popularity of the drink .
The international growth of Coca Cola began in 1900 when a son of the company's founder took a jug of syrup with him on a vacation to England .
The same year , Coca Cola traveled to Cuba and Puerto Rico , where bottling operations soon began as they did in Panama . The Philippines and Guam .
The first Bottling Company on the European continent began operation in France in 1920 .
Coca-Cola and the Olympics began their association in the summer of 1928 , when an American freighter arrived in Amsterdam carrying the United States Olympic team and 1,000 cases of Coca cola 40 thousand spectators filled the stadium to witness 2 firsts the first lighting of the Olympic flame and the first sale of Coke at an Olympiad .
Many people outside the United States had their first taste of Coca-Cola during World War II .
When 64 bottling plants were shipped abroad to provide more than 5 billion bottles of Coke for American service personnel in Europe and the Pacific .
In the next 20 years , the number of countries with bottling operations nearly doubled .
The worldwide appeal of Coca Cola was dramatically displayed in 1971 when young people from around the world gathered on a hilltop in Italy to sing I'd Like To Buy The World A Coke presenting a unifying global spirit .
In 1976 . The well-known advertising slogan . The pause that refreshes was joined by a new slogan Coke adds life .
A few years later , have a Coke and a Smile was added . And in 1982 the theme Coke is It was launched around the world followed by can't beat the feeling in the late eighty's and can't beat the real thing in the early ninety's .
The pause that refreshes has come a long way in 109 years .
Food and wine are among the great attractions of a trip to Italy .
The traveler who seeks out interesting eating places will find Italy a dream come true .
The Italian-style of cooking is hearty and varied .
You'll discover that generous use of olive oil garlic and tomato is confined largely in the SOUTH in Rome and to the north . It is not so frequent in the far north cooking in butter is preferred .
Whether you sit down in one of those vast luxury hotels or in a cheaper restaurant , the food is likely to be good . Although the prices will vary greatly .
Breakfast is the usual Continental version It consists of coffee with hot milk or tea or hot chocolate . If you prefer bread and rolls and jam or marmalade .
The main meals lunch and dinner . Both consist of several courses .
Lunch is around usually at one o'clock and dinner . Around 7:30 PM . It may be later in Rome .
Lunch and dinner menus usually both consist of the following courses Antipasta includes olives mushrooms eggs tomatoes ETC , you should also try cured ham with iced melon or fresh figs .
Entree can be soup often of vegetables and Herbs This may be rice cooked with mushrooms or liver ETC or it may be one of the assorted flour based Foods diversely shaped pieces of pasta filled with a meat or vegetable mixture or the famous pizza These are followed by fish from the Mediterranean or the lakes or meat dishes , those being ready to serve are listed under today's special and are accompanied by a variety of vegetables .
These usually are ordered separately potatoes , green vegetables and salad .
Cheese is an important part of an Italian meal and most restaurants offer a wide variety of them some produced in small family establishments in the Meadowlands of Alps others known and exported all over the world .
Then comes fruit in season . And finally the dessert , which can be sweeter than anything you ever tasted .
Of course we cannot forget its famous table wines dessert wines and Beer and there is also a wide selection of mineral waters .
Finally , you can hardly think of Italy without thinking of ice cream . Today the best producers of ice cream are the Sicilians and Napolitans .
In short , eating in Italy can be a real experience or it can be a matter of deadly monotony their difference lies in whether you are willing to try something new and know the specialties of the various Regions , make it an adventure by seeking out unusual restaurants interesting because of historical significance because of their setting or because of some other characteristics that make them unusual .
Hours spent beneath a vine draped pergola or on a sunlit Terrace before the unforgettable scenery of land and sea may well be the most pleasant memories of your trip to Italy .
As America is home to so many different nationalities . One can find almost any kind of restaurant in all the large cities .
The restaurants can range widely in cost from inexpensive to very expensive .
But fast food shops have become very widespread in the US because they are quick and cheap .
And cafeterias are especially popular with American students .
There you can get a variety of food such as fried fish barbecued chicken spaghetti salad vegetables macaroni sweet potatoes , rice hot rolls .
There are also desserts and drinks .
You can pick up whatever strikes your fancy .
Tips are generally not required at cafeterias where you serve yourself and you are expected to clear your own table of dishes and utensils and discard your trash in the garbage cans .
In most cafeterias you stand in LINE as you walk along you select items available at a counter .
At normal mealtimes cafeterias are crowded with people you can usually get a seat without waiting too long . If you eat a little early , or a little late .
Students entering the cafeterias on the campus are required to present their own valid meal cards student ID cards and any other identification must be presented if requested by dining hall staff student managers or checkers .
An individual who refuses to show a student ID card will be considered a non-student and a trespasser and will be denied entrance and be told to leave the premises .
Dining at a students' cafeteria students are required to follow some rules .
For example , once diners leave the dining hall . They will not be allowed to re-enter during that meal no food glass or other dining services' property may be removed from the Dining Hall It is expected that students will be courteous to fellow students and dining hall personnel while in it , you are not allowed to break the Line any action that jeopardizes the safety of other students is Prohibited no student if barefooted will be permitted to enter the Dining Hall Moreover , alcoholic beverages and drugs are not permitted there People under the influence of alcohol or drugs will be required to leave .
Another thing that makes a students' cafeteria different from one-off of the campus is the way of payment dining charges are payable in the same manner as tuition and other fees .
The peoples of the Scandinavian countries share many affinities because of geographical reasons but there are more of differences than similarities between them in all aspects , including their drinking cultures .
A superficial observer might think that no one in Norway drinks liquor or wine .
Meals eaten in restaurants or at home are usually washed down with tea , coffee or milk occasionally however pale or dark ale is drunk .
It can be ordered only in restaurants where it is served only with food .
Excellent quality beers are made in Jutland and consumption is high .
After beer brandy is the favorite drink .
Aalborg schnapps made from corn and potatoes is famous for its high alcoholic content .
For the Danes brandy is also an aperitif , and is frequently drunk before meals .
For a foreigner . The practice of surrounding toasts here can be embarrassing .
If he accepts one toast , then he is obliged to accept all others and it is difficult to drink 6 or 7 glasses of brandy unless one is used to it .
Ladies are fortunately excluded from these rounds and they drink only a grape juice with almost no alcoholic content .
It is milk instead of liquor . That is the principal Finnish table drink .
More milk is drunk by the Finnish people than in any other nation .
It is made of curdled milk and a kind of yogurt-like substance which is a dish on its own . The latter is especially popular in summer .
A number of home-brewed beers include one made from juniper berries 2 well-known Finnish liquors are made from cloudberry and Arctic Bramble .
In Finland , the sale of alcohol is a state monopoly and a check is kept on consumption by recording purchases on a special card issued to all customers .
As there is a distinction between Swedish cooking in the south , and that in the north . Because of the difference in soil and climate their drinking habits are also different .
In the north , alcoholic beverages are considered a necessity because they keep out the cold . And as the Swedish humorist Alber Engstrom said Because gaiety without alcohol is forced .
The Swedes drink brown ale lager brand and potato spirit .
While in the south . People have milder drinks .
But generally speaking excessive drinking is rare in Sweden , partly because the legal penalties against drunkenness are severe partly because alcohol is rationed .
Sale of spirits is controlled commerce in alcohol being a State monopoly the Swedes drink a lot of coffee and tea .
Although all the large towns have coffee bars with modern espresso machines many people still prefer the old-fashioned coffee served in large cups and accompanied by buns and cakes .
Tea is so popular in Sweden that it has been called the Swedish national drink .

About 10 minutes , I suppose .
Could you give me some information about trains for Beijing .
Certainly there are a number of trains from Guangzhou to Beijing .
Which do you prefer to go straight to Beijing or to visit some places of interest on the way .
Are there places of interest on the way to Beijing .
Oh A LOT For example Changsha is famous for its beautiful scenery and ancient tomb at Mawangdui .
Mawangdui .
Is it the place where a well-preserved woman's corpse from ancient times was excavated .
Exactly .
I am interested in cultural relics .
I would like to pay a visit there .
Then I suggest you book the berth ticket for Changsha because if you get off the train at Changsha your berth ticket for Beijing will be invalid .
Thank you for your advice .
Any other places , do you think I should visit on the way to Beijing .
You may visit Yueyang and Dongting Lake .
Yueyang is a city by Dongting Lake in North Hunan .

How far is it from Guangzhou to Chengdu .
It is about 2000 and 500 kilometers .
How long does it take me to get there by train .
It's about 60 hours .
Alas .
It's more than 2 days .
But you can see the beautiful scenery on the way .
Traveling by train is really an enjoyment .
Yes , I think so .
That's why I decided to go there by train .
May I visit Dalian on the way to Harbin .
No , I am afraid not .
The train from Beijing to Harbin doesn't pass by Dalian .
Then what shall I do .
If you want to visit Dalian on your way to Harbin , you have to change trains at Shenyang or you may take the express train from Beijing to Dalian .
Is there a through train from Dalian to Harbin .

I am going to Nanjing but I should like to visit places of interest on The Way : Would you please give me some information about them .
Certainly .
I'll tell you something about the scenic spots on the way to Nanjing .
I think you should first visit Suzhou and Wuxi .
Suzhou is world-famous for its delicate elegant and graceful gardens and WuXi is attractive for the natural beauty of Taihu Lake .
I should say I would visit these 2 wonderful places .
Any other places may I visit .
Zhenjiang and Yangzhou are also attractions for tourists .
Zhenjiang on the southern bank of the Changjiang River is known as the 3 hill scenic spot .
It is screened on 3 sides by 3 Hills with the other side facing the turbulent river .
That's really wonderful .
How about Yangzhou .
Yangzhou is a city of historic interest .
It attracts the travelers for the Grand Canal and other historic sites .
How many kinds of carriages are there in China .
There are 4 .
Are they called the first class car second class car and so on .
No they are called hard seat car soft seat car hard berth sleeper and soft berth sleeper .
What is each of them like .
Now you are in a soft berth sleeper .
It is the most comfortable coach .
It is divided into several compartments .
Each compartment has 2 cushioned bunk beds and a desk with a reading lamp on it .
What's the difference between a hard berth sleeper and a soft berth one .
A hard berth sleeper is a semi-cushioned sleeping car .
There are upper berths middle berths and lower berths , but no compartments .
Then how about hard seat and soft seat cars .
A hard seat car is a car with semi cushioned seats .
It's usually crowded as China has got such a large population .
The ticket is rather cheap .
The car is suitable for a short ride .
In some railway lines such as from Guangzhou , to Shenzhen there are soft seat cars .
A soft seat car holds less people .
The seat is a cushioned chair which can be turned around in any direction .
You can also lie in the chair by lowering the upholstered back .
Can you lend us a pack of playing cards .
We have forgotten to bring one with us .
Sorry all the playing cards have been lent out .
We have some magazines and pictorials in English .
Would you like to have any .
There will be a tea party in the dining car this evening .
Would you go .
Yes what time .
8 o'clock in the evening .
Can I drink beer instead of tea .
Surely .
Excuse me . May I get off the train halfway .
Yes , but how many days , are you going to stay there .
I'm not sure .
Perhaps it will take me at least 3 days to do my business .
You know that the period of availability of your ticket is only a days .
If I can't finish my business within that time what shall I do .
In that case , you should buy another ticket . If you want to continue your journey .
Well I should try to finish my work as early as possible so that I'll not pay the double money for the distance .
It's a pity that I have lost my ticket .
When and where did you lose it .
It might have been lost . While I was buying something on the platform at a station .
Take it easy .
Do you still remember where your berth or seat is .
Yes I do .
And there are some people sitting around me familiar with me .
That's fine .
You can go where you were .
Please inform us if there is anyone who is going to take your place with the ticket .
Thank you very much for your great help .
I was thinking that I would not be allowed to take the train .
Well , we will see what the situation is .
That means that not everyone who is without ticket on the train is treated like this .
I think so .
It's reasonable .
Would you mind closing the window .
Of course not .
Are you feeling cold .
Yes , a bit .
I wonder if it would be very cold in Guangzhou , when I get there .
No the nearer we go to the south . The warmer . It will be .
It is still quite warm in Guangzhou now .
That's marvelous .
I was considering buying an overcoat when I arrive in Guangzhou .
Now I know it's not necessary .
I don't think so either .
So as far as I know the yearly average temperature in Guangzhou is about 21° Celsius .
Excuse me , I've lost my handbag .

Yes , but please sign your name here .
Is that all .
Yes , that's all .
Thank you very much .
You Chinese people are all very honest .
This is what we should do .
Welcome to Guangzhou .
Thank you .
Have you ever been in China before .
I've been in China . Several times and have visited many places .
What places are you going to visit this time .
I'm going to visit Beijing and Xi'an .
Have you ever been there before .
I've visited Beijing several times .
The last time I went to Beijing was 5 years ago .
I expect there have been great changes since then .
As for Xi'an , I've never been there .
Xi'an is the city you must visit .
It is best known for the Qin tombs with their pottery warriors and horses .
I was told , they are really wonderful .
By the way , will you please tell me how to get there by train .
Certainly .
I suggest you go to Beijing . First .
There are express passenger trains from Guangzhou to Beijing .
And after you've visited Beijing you may take through trains from Beijing to Xi'an .
Good idea . Thank you very much .
You are welcome .
Welcome to Beijing .
Thank you .
Are you on tour or on business .
I'm on tour .
I would like to visit some places with beautiful scenery .
Then you must go to Guilin and Hangzhou .
These 2 cities I've visited .
They are really wonderful .
Then I recommend Zhangjiajie .
It has begun attracting quite a few foreign tourists in recent years .
Some of them even prefer it to Guilin .
Really .
Where is it .
Zhangjiajie is situated in the west of Hunan province .
It is famous for its natural beauty .
Would you tell me how to get there .
Certainly .
From Beijing . You can take the Beijing Kunming express passenger train to Huaihua and from Huaihua take another train to Dayong .
And there are buses running between Dayong and Zhangjiajie .
Oh I see .
Thank you .
Not at all .
Welcome to China .
Thanks .
Is it the first time you come to China .
Yes , it is my first visit to China .
May I know your traveling plans .
I want to visit some Chinese cities with cultural relics .
Then I recommend you visit Beijing and Xi'an .
I should say I would .
I've heard so much about them .
Thank you for your advice .
Not at all .
Welcome to China .
Thanks . It is the first time I come to China .
I'd like to have some sightseeing there .
What places do you plan to visit .
I have no idea about it .
China is such a vast country .
Well , what's your suggestion .
How about Guilin .
Guilin is considered one of the most beautiful places in China .
That's a good idea .
Thank you very much .
You are welcome .
I was told Mount Lushan is a charming summer resort .
Yes it is .
Mount Lushan is famous for its imposing peaks and mysterious mist .
I've heard much of its beautiful scenery but seeing is believing I wish to see it with my own eyes .
Will you please tell me how to get there .
Certainly .
You may first take a train to Nanchang which is the capital of Jiangxi province .
Then you take the train to Jiujiang and from Jiujiang to mount Lushan There are many buses .
You mean it is very easy for me to go from Jiujiang to mount Lushan .
That's right .
Wish you a happy journey .
Thank you .
I am going to Xiamen . But I should like to visit Fuzhou too .
Does the train from Shanghai to Xiamen pass by Fuzhou .
No the Shanghai to Xiamen passenger train doesn't pass by Fuzhou .
Then what shall I do .
There is a fast passenger train from Xiamen to Fuzhou .
After you have visited Xiamen . You may go straight to Fuzhou .
Need I go back to Xiamen after I visited Fuzhou .
No you needn't .
There are through trains from Fuzhou to Nanjing and Beijing .
And from Nanjing and Beijing . I can easily go to other places of interest , am I right .
Exactly .
From Nanjing and Beijing . You can go to almost all parts of China by train .
What's the temperature in the compartment .
It's 11° Centigrade .
I feel rather cold .
I didn't expect it would be so cold here .
Since China covers , a vast area , there is a great difference of temperature between the north and the south .
I'll get you another woolen blanket .
Thank you . But I should like to have a quilt .
I'll fetch you a quilt and an overcoat .
It is really thoughtful of you .

I'm a little nervous .
I've never flown before .
There's nothing to worry about .
Once you're up in the air . It's just like sitting in your own living room .
Fasten your seat belts , please .
Welcome to flight 217 now departing for Los Angeles .
What's the terrible noise .
The engines .
The crew is warming them UP , we're about to take off .
Look . We're leaving the ground .
Bob stop clenching your teeth and open your eyes .
We're already in the air .
Look down below and see how Toronto looks from the air .
Now my ears hurt .
I suppose that's the atmospheric pressure .
How many things can happen to you in an airplane .
Nothing serious is going to happen to you .
Just sit back and relax .
Excuse me , Do You Want headphones for the movie .

David Jackson from Phoenix , Arizona .
Zhonghua Yang from Beijing .
On a business trip .
Yes is yours also for business .
Both yes and no .
I'm a businessman , but I came as a tourist .
Then during the tour . I ran into a very interesting Chinese businessman and I found , we can do a lot of business together .
It's truly interesting .
I think as China's economic reform deepens . There will be more opportunities for foreign businessmen .
I feel the same way .
Your country has now become a land of opportunity .
As a matter of fact , I'll come back next month with a detailed proposal .
Good for you .
Oh this is my boss Mr. Kang li .
Excuse me , Would you mind trading seats with me .
Not at all .
Oh , thank you .
You're welcome .
I prefer a window seat .
Oh , you do .
Yes .
Good .
Looking out of the window . Sometimes scares me so I prefer to sit in the middle .
Good afternoon , ladies and gentlemen .
Welcome to this flight .
It's 1325 Beijing time .
The plane is about to take off in 3 minutes so fasten your seatbelts . Please .
Thank you .
Excuse me . May I know your nationality .
I'm from the States .
You're Chinese I guess .
Yes you are right .
Are you going to Romania .
I mean what's your destination .
I'm on my way to London changing planes in Bucharest .
Same here .
But why don't you fly straight to London .
It's cheaper going this way .
There's a 50% discount for both Chinese and Romanian passengers for this flight .
Is that so .
That's fine .
Why didn't you go by Beijing London plane .
I'm going to travel across Europe by train . So as to do some sightseeing on the way .
That's a good idea , but wouldn't it be even more expensive than flying .
Staying at hotels and going about sightseeing would cost a lot , surely .
You bet .
But it's worth it .
Yes , when you happen to have the time and money for it .
Look .
That's a lovely bird's eye view of the Summer Palace .
Wow .
That's great .
You've been sightseeing Beijing I suppose .
Yes .
I started from San Francisco and stopped over at Hawaii Tokyo and Beijing .
My next stopover will be in Bucharest then Geneva then Paris and finally London .
I guess I'll be just in time for the next semester .
So you are going to college in England , too .
Yes . I'll be at Oxford .
What about you .
Going to Cambridge .
No , I'm going to London University .
What's your subject .
English literature .
And yours .
European history , of course .
Why did you say , of course .
What would an american go to college in England for if not for European history .
Hush don't let any Englishmen hear that .
No I won't they are sure to get mad , to hear it .
I wouldn't have said it , if you were British .
What's your name . Please .
My name is . Li Li .
Pleased to meet you .
And yours .
Bob Bedson .
I'm glad to know you too .
Your first name , Bob must be the shortened form of a Christian name isn't it .
Yes it's short for Robert .
You'll be in London . Before I get there I guess .
Yes , I think so .
Perhaps we'll come across each other again in England . One never knows .
Yea , maybe we'll bump into each other in a London street .
I wouldn't be surprised if we do .
As the English saying goes . This is a small world .
What do you want madam coffee or tea .
White coffee please .
Thank you .
And you , sir .
Just a glass of orangeade or lemonade please if you have any .
Here's orange juice will it do .
It'll do fine .
Thanks a lot .
I suppose you don't want to be kept awake in the night but there won't be any night before we reach our destination .
We are going in the same direction as the sun .
Yeah , that reminds me that we'll have to readjust our watches . Before we get to Bucharest .
Yes . Putting the time several hours back .
The announcer will tell us when to do it , I think .
The trouble is , we'll have to sleep under a bright sun .
I know .
That's why I don't dare have any tea or coffee not before I fall asleep , anyway .
Gosh .
What's happening .
I think we've entered an air pocket .
Yes , we must be flying over some mountainous region . Maybe the Himalayas .
Do you get airsick sometimes .
Not when it's a smooth flight .
I've never been on any air journey as rough as this one before .
Where have you been by plane .
I've only been flying over the American prairies the Pacific Ocean and Yellow Sea and never over any mountains before .
Well , this may prove to be quite an experience for you .
In case you feel sick and want to throw up . There should be a bag for it in that big pocket at the back of the seat in front of you .
Here it is .
You seem to know everything there is to know on a plane .
One would think you'd been an air hostess or someone like that .
You are nearly right .
As a matter of fact , I've been a tourism interpreter guide for English speaking tourists in the last 2 years .
No wonder you speak very good English much better English than what most American and British people speak .
You're flattering me .
In fact , it's not flattering but joking .
No , I'm not kidding you .
What I mean to say is , you speak almost perfect English whereas most English speaking people speak with all kinds of local accents and quite a lot of people's grammar is shocking .
Really .
I'm surprised to hear that .
Just wait till you are in London and you'll see what I mean .
There it goes again .
.
That jerk nearly tossed my orange juice to the ceiling .
Look .
It's spilt .
Hold on to your glass Bob .
Don't spill it all over the Himalayas .
I don't think the people there like Orange Juice they prefer tea , you know .
How long does the flight take .
Only 40 minutes .
Thank you .
You're welcome . Sir .
Have a nice trip .

Thank you very much .

I think I must have left it by your airline counter at the airport .
Don't worry , sir , Can you tell me what it is like .
Yes , the brand is Omega .
All right , I'll have our ground personnel try to find it for you .
I really appreciate your Help This is my card .

Drivers play both roles of driver and conductor .
You have to get on in the front and drop your fare into a metal box .
Oh , thanks .
What are you waiting for .
Get on the bus quickly .
But where do I get a ticket .
On the Bus the conductor collects the fares .
You'll have to take your luggage on board .

It is said that the United States is a country driven by automobiles .
Yes . And Americans are actually a people living on wheels .
Americans like to do business without leaving their CARS wherever you go . You'll see drive in banks Drive-In Restaurant drive in churches and driven in movies .
If a man visits the United States with a tourist visa . Can he drive in the country .
So far as I know he can .
When he drives in the US , it's a good idea to have an international driver's license . If he is a foreigner and doesn't have a state license .
Does he need to buy a car in order to travel in America .
I suppose America has some kind of car rental service .
Hertz and Avis are 2 largest American car rental companies which have offices all over the US with counters at most airports and in many international cities so visitors may want to reserve a car through their travel agent in their own countries .
Then , how does he pay for his rental service .
He has to have a major credit card such as Master Card Visa or American Express .
Without a credit card . He has to pay a very high deposit on the car .
If he doesn't want to spend a lot of money . He may rent used cars from used car rental companies .
Of course he can also stop a cab on the street , but that's not easy in many cities , it's actually easier to call a taxi company listed in the yellow pages of a telephone directory and ask them to send a cab to your door .
Thank you very much for the information .
You're welcome .

It's bumper-to-bumper all the way .

No , I didn't , I'll read it now . Okay , I understand .

Could you please explain why .
All the companies have the same policy .
Oh .
Sorry about the confusion .
Where do you want to go .
Zhongshan University .
What do you figure out the car fare for .
We figure out the fare by kilometerage The first 3 kilometers are 8 yuan , then every extra kilometer costs 1 yuan . You can read the kilometerage on the meter .

Well , that depends on the traffic .

I have to admit , I really don't know where I am going .
I just want to visit some place here .
Do you want my advice .
Sure , where do you think I can go .
Why not go to the beach .
It's a great day to be at the beach . Lots of people there .
Excuse me Mr. Driver .
What's up miss .
Is traffic always like this .
Not really .
Today is especially bad .
We're barely moving .
One of the lanes is blocked .
It looks like we're stuck .
What happened .
There may be an accident up ahead .
Oh . No. Look 2 cars smashed into each other .
One of the cars was completely deformed its driver was covered with blood all over .
How dreadful . It is .
Traffic will be slow for a while .
What's the problem .
I don't know .
There may be an accident , down the road .
You might be right .
There's a police officer directing traffic .
I see , car crashes , all too often .
What's the reason for so many accidents .
Pedestrians and drivers don't obey the traffic rules .
Where do you come from .
I come from Australia .
Which city do you live in .
I live in Sydney .
That's a beautiful coastal city .
Yes , right .
Where's your hometown .
York .
It's strange to me .
Where's that on Earth .
It's an old city in England .
No wonder that I don't know it .
You say you live in Paris .
What's the scenery like there .
It's wonderful .
I know the Eiffel Tower is very famous across the world .
Would you please tell me when the tower was built .
The tower was completed in 1889 designed by Mr. Alexandre Gustave Eiffel .
How high is it .
It is about 300 meters high .
Well I've seen plenty of the tower pictures before but I've never seen the tower itself .
I hope you'll get your chance .
Where do you want to go .
I want to see the Summer Palace .
It's very beautiful .
And my friends suggested Chairman Mao's Memorial Hall .
What places would you like to see .
I really want to see the Guangzhou night market .
If not late . I also want to see Night Landscape alongside the Pearl River .
So you'll return home after that .
Correct .
What places would you like to see .
The Great Wall and Tian'anmen Square .
But I only have 5 days here .
And then you'll fly back home .
No .
I have several other trips to make first .
Where will you travel to .
My friends suggested Panyu Xiangjiang Wild Animals Zoo .
Will you go home after your trip .
Actually I'll fly to Hong Kong first because I have an important business negotiation with a company there .
What do you do for a living .
I'm a business person by trade .
In what industry .
Toys and something like that .
How about your business now .
Just so .
Because the global economy is in a depression now .
Driving a taxi must be fun .
Yes , I think so .
I'm envious .
Well , it has its drawbacks too .
Hi , sir .
First time here .
You mean in Beijing .
No , I mean in China .
Oh Actually , this is my second trip .
What do you think of Beijing .
It is a beautiful place .
Beijing has many historic spots and interest places .
What scenic spots have you visited .
The Great Wall .
Have you ever heard that only 2 things can be observed by astronauts from Space the Chinese great walls and Egyptian pyramids .
Sure , but I remember an old Chinese saying one is not a true man unless he comes to the Great Wall .
Can you tell me where does this proverb come from .
I think the reasons are almost the following 2 Firstly several wars broke out here , historically .
Secondly , how could the ancient working people to transport so large and heavy stones , bricks and lime to the dangerous top of the walls . Since there were no modern machines .
Oh , it sounds very interesting .
What do you think of Chinese food .
I love it .
Which kind of food is your favorite .
Roast suckling pigs and wax gourd soup in Guangdong flavor dishes .
I'm glad you like them .
But do you know what's the main characteristic of Guangdong flavor dishes .
No .
Would you please give me an introduction of it .
It emphasizes 4 parts color smell , taste and shape and it can satisfy not only your taste but also your view .
No wonder that eating in Guangzhou is wildly known .
Chinese food is tasty , don't you think .
Actually I'm not used to the food .
It can be a little greasy .
But I like drinking Chinese wine .
Chinese wine has many varieties including white spirit Shaoxing wine fruit wine , beer medicinal liquor and makes up wine roughly .
Which kind of wine is your favorite .
Beer Qingdao beer .
And how about Maotai wine and Erguotou .
Oh the degree is too high .
Does everybody here so like drinking .
Not quite right it differs from person to person and from place to place for example Northern people are better at drinking than southern people .
This is my first time in China .
How do you like it here .
It's nice .
The people are very friendly .
Do you like the food .
Oh yes .
Chinese food is delicious .
Is there anything you don't like .
Well , the traffic is TERRIBLE and the pollution is bad .
How do you study .
I learn from the radio .
And I practice with Occidental .
You mean like me .
Bingo .
Do you speak English .
A little , but not very much .
Actually English is not a very hard language .
But I find it is difficult to remember words .
Can you give me some suggestions .
In my view , you'd better go to English training school in your spare time .
Is it very useful like that .
Yes , I believe it .
That was a comfortable trip .
That's music to my ears .
Keep up the good work .
You bet .
Taxi .
No thank you .
But where are you going .
I can walk there .
Good afternoon .
How's it going .
Not bad .
How about yourself .
Just so-so .
We're moving so slowly .
Traffic is really heavy today .
Is it like this everyday .
I'm afraid so .
From 5 to 7:00 PM . The streets are really crowded .
Is there any way around the traffic .
We can try another route .
To do it can't be better .
Thank you .
You are welcome .
We're going at a snail's pace .
Yes .
It's a pretty bad JAM .
I should have waited until after rush hour .
Hi .
Look .
Vehicles ahead are moving faster and faster .
Oh . Thank God .
Don't tell me it's this way everyday .
For mornings and evenings . This is normal .
We're moving so slowly .
It's because of a big construction site .
It's no wonder that how serious the traffic jam is .
Look .
There is a crane ahead that is hanging a large concrete pipe .
Damned traffic .
What's the problem .
I'm not sure .
Look there's an accident .
That red car smashed into that black truck .
Let's hope nobody was hurt .
Traffic has completely stopped .
What's going on .
I see a crash at the next intersection .
Look , there are several police cars .
Oh my God .
A bicycle rider was knocked down to the ground , seeming to be injured seriously .
I hear an ambulance .
Car accidents are common in the United States .
Why is that .
Some motorists don't drive carefully .
But in China , most of motorists will concentrate their spirit on driving .
In a word , car accidents can't be completely avoided .
Right .
I appreciate your driving skills , very much .
Thank you .
Accidents happen all too often .
How come .
The traffic rules aren't enforced .
I see .
Car accident again .
This is why the traffic paralysis happened .
Do you see car accidents much often .
Yes .
What's the reason for so many accidents .
Motorists don't obey the traffic rules .
Unlucky .
It looks like we're stuck .
What happened .
There was probably an accident up ahead .
I think you're right .
I hear an ambulance .
Sadly accidents are very common .
Why is that .
People like driving fast and don't drive carefully .
What country are you from .
Canada .
It's the second largest country in area across the world .
Yes it is .
And which part of Canada do you come from .
Vancouver in Western Canada .
It is a famous port city .

Yes .
How many days . Will you be staying here .

You should stay longer to visit some scenic spots in Beijing .
I think I'll get my chance next time .
How long are you staying in China .
Actually I live here .
Well , you are very familiar with Shanghai .
Yes , that's right .
Shanghai has been my second hometown .
If you don't mind . Please come to my home for dinner in your spare time .

Yes , that's right .
What do you do .
I'm an agent in China for an overseas electronics company .
In my view , you must be very familiar with China's market in this regard .
Sure .
I have stayed in China for nearly 8 years .
Oh I see .
All the best of luck in your business .

It's a big European firm .

Well I can work when I want to .
Right .
And I'm my own boss .
But sometimes it's dangerous to drive a taxi late at night .
Yes , that's righ .
What do you think of being a taxi driver .
It's interesting .
What's more I have been dreaming of driving since my childhood .
Is that righ .
Yes .
And I like to be independent .
Actually I was also a taxi driver . 2 years ago .
I like driving as well .
But now I run an automobile trade company .

Good luck with yours .
Thank you very much .
Excuse me sir .
Yes .
What can I do for you .
I want to have a talk with you .
Sure , Why not .
What's it like driving a taxi here .
Sometimes it's BORING . But it can be stressful .
I see .
What do you do . Sir .
I'm a salesperson .
Really .
What do you sell .
Food products .
I work for a big Australian company .
That sounds interesting .
It's not bad .
Driving a taxi must be very exciting .
I think so .
Have you been to China before .
Yes .
This is my second time here .
When was your last visit .
About 2 years ago .
How do you like it here .
Shenzhen is a beautiful city with developed economy smooth transportation and picturesque environment .

Business or pleasure .
I came on business before but this time , I'm here to sightsee .
Have you visited the Imperial Palace in Beijing .
No .
I am going to visit it tomorrow .
Can you give me brief introduction of it .
Sure .
The Imperial Palace was built in ancient times .
It was called the Forbidden City formerly it's an imperial palace for emperors during the Ming and Qing Dynasty .
Do you know why it was called so .
Because the legendary Jade Emperor of China lives in the center of the North Pole Ziweiyuan but the emperor considered himself as supreme as God so called himself the son of heaven and the place where he lived was called Imperial palace Imperial is a place , which forbade the common people to enter .
Very good explanation .
You are an expert about Chinese history .
I'm flattered .
Thank you .
So what's your impression of China .
Well I just arrived last night , but it seems nice .
How do you like the food .
Actually , I haven't had any Chinese food yet .
What dish do you firstly think of in Beijing dishes .
It's the roast Beijing Ducks .
Right .
It enjoys great reputation across China and its taste is very delicious .
I suggest , you'd better have a taste of it tonight .
Thank you for your recommendation .
What do you think of China .
All in all , I like it .
Have you been outside of Beijing .
Yes , I just came back from Guangzhou .
What places have you visited .
Chen Academy , which is located in Guangzhou downtown .
How about your impression of Chen Academy .
In my view it is the most famous classical type of construction in the south of China .
It's been labeled as the folk Craft Exhibition Hall of Canton with various handicraft articles on display .
Does it mean that we can see all of the typical articles of Canton .
That's right .
Almost all of the valuable handicraft articles are there .
Could you tell me your opinion of China .
Like every country , it has its good and bad points .
Right .
I've found the people-friendly and generous .
Are you interested in investing to run a factory in China .
Oh this is just my purpose of the Chinese trip .
I think that it is a great chance for my company to come into China after its accession to WTO .
I believe China and its people will welcome you .
Wish you success in China .
Thank you very much .
I hope I can .
Your English is so fluent .
Really .
Thank you .
Learning English is very important for my job .
Yes .
With China's entry into WTO its international exchange increased more and more foreigners come to CHINA . But not many foreigners can speak Chinese .
That's right .
Actually , the fact that taxi drivers can speak English shows one of Chinese government's decisions to reform and open up to the outside world .
Your grammar is fantastic .
Really .
I don't think so .
Really it is .
Thank you very much .
I'm impressed by your pronunciation .
Thank you .
You're welcome .
I do my best to improve . Bit by bit .
You speak idiomatic English .
Thank you .
How did you learn English .
I watch an English-language program on CCTV .
That's impressive .
Well , I don't understand everything .
It doesn't matter .
If making persistent efforts you will speak fluent English in the near future .
Thank you .
I hope I can .
What's your secret .
Watching TV shows helps me improve and I watch video tapes .
How do you practice .
I read English magazines and newspapers .
Do you think it will be very boring .
Sometimes it will be .
But for the sake of smoothly communicating with foreigners , I'll be persistent .
Great .
Your English is great .
Thank you .
I try to study English everyday .
Do you go to class .
No , I don't have time .
Then how do you study .
I listen to tapes , I also practice with foreign passengers .
You are really a man good at taking advantage of opportunities for study .
I'm flattered .
Thanks a lot .
You know , I'd have no clue what to do if I lost something important while here in the US .
Well if it's your credit card call the credit card company right away so nobody else can use the card .
Good idea .
What if I lose something in a public place like a zoo or something .
Any public place should have a lost and found .
If not the nearest police station would be the best place to get help .
Thanks very much for your Help . I really appreciate it .
Well I'm afraid it's too late to take the buses .
Let's take a taxi .
Taxi .
Where to .
Saint Paul Hotel , please .
Is it the one near the beach .

It is still running .
Yes .

Sorry , what does it mean by mileage here .
It's the extra cost for each kilometer you drive on the Car For example , if you drive a subcompact for 100 kilometers . You'll have to pay $15 for mileage .
Oh I see .
And what is Fuel Economy .
That's how far on a gallon of gas say a subcompact can run 35km on 1 gallon of gas .
One last question What difference does it make if I get full insurance coverage .
In that case , you wouldn't be liable for any cost if there's an accident .
What do you recommend .
That depends on how you want to use your car .
If you drive it out of town . I would suggest a Luxury Sedan it's safer and more comfortable but you may want a subcompact . If you use it locally .

Hi , Chen What are you doing these days .
I've called you many times and nobody answered the PHONE nice to have found you .
Oh I'm Sorry I've been busy since last month .
Guess what .
I do get a job in a travel agency .
Great .
What is it exactly .
Well most of my work is concerned with holidays both at home AND abroad . Now we're sending out booklets which describe holiday Tours' arrangement next year .
Surprisingly customers have already begun to come into the office and book their holidays .
It sounds wonderful .
Do you like this job .
Sure .
Sometimes I advise people on what kind of holiday tours will be suitable for them and get ready to answer piles of questions .
I'm glad to help different customers .
Good . Give me your office number .
I'll call you for a consultation next time I take a trip somewhere .
Okay .
Hello , Mike .
Where are you going .
Hello , Tom .
I'm going to the hospital to see the doctor .
Oh you look pale today .
What's wrong with you .
I've been a bit under the weather for the last few days , I think I have a bad cold and now I feel a little bit feverish .
I'm sorry to hear THAT : How did you get the cold .
I was caught in heavy rain last Sunday and was wet to the skin .
So I suppose that was how I get cold .
Yes , that's the easiest way to catch cold , sometimes it's difficult to shake off a cold .
Yes . I'd better go to see the doctor at once .
I think you'll get over it soon .
I hope so . Thank you . Goodbye .
Goodbye .
Jane . Good afternoon .
What a surprise .
Yes . It's funny to run into each other like that .
Did you have a nice day so far .
All right . Nothing very special , just enjoy myself .
Do you have time .
We could have a cup of coffee together .
Sure , but I won't be able to stay very long .
Hi , Chen haven't seen you for a long time .
How is it going .
I've just come back from thailand an exciting trip .
Really travel seems to appeal to you wonderfully .
You're right and I may draw upon those good memories and again have the please of past experiences some day .
Another advantage of travel is that it broadens people's perspectives . In other words , people learn a lot during their travels .
But travel is also Costly . I can't imagine that a person works hard . The whole year and then spends all his savings within a couple of days just for seeing landscape and meeting people of different colors and races .
I AGREE . However , many people are choosing ways to travel in a less costly fashion .
I am afraid that I cannot afford long trips with my Salary . But if I work in a travel agency I could find some chances to travel cheaply or even without paying .
Good idea : Why not give it a try .
Look at the highway outside now our bus is going very fast .
Yeah , it seems to be going at least 80 miles an hour .
I've been looking for traffic lights but there don't seem to be any .
This is a good quality highway and very Wide it has 8 lanes .
I feel as if I'm back in the States .
You see the barrier area in the middle of the highway is also very wide and the information signs are large enough to see from far away .
These symbols are all internationally standardized .
Yes , very standardized .
Good morning , Mr. Brown .
Good morning . Mr. Li .
How are you .
Very well . Thank you .
And how are you .
Fine , thanks .
Where are you going .

A bookstore on Nathan Road .

You should walk across and turn left .
Does the number 5 bus stop at Wooster Street .
Yes .
How often does this bus run .
It runs every 10 minutes .
Thank you very much .
Welcome .

Oh that's too bad .

Yes , the subway system in Guangzhou is good .
Is it convenient to travel by bus .

You're welcome .
You take care and drive safe .
Bye-bye .
Okay . What happened .
Officer I got rear ended .

Yes , you can't miss it .

It's very far away from here .
It takes more than half an hour to get there on foot .

Can you see it .
Oh yes .
Thanks a lot .
You're welcome .
Excuse me .
I lost my way .
Where am I .
You are in this place on the map .
How can I get to the national museu .
You'd better take number 8 bus and get off at the Park station .
Is this the right way to the bus station .
No it isn't .
Turn right at the next corner and go straight on .
Thank you very much .
You really save the day for me .

Excuse me sir , I'm a stranger here and have lost my way .
Where do you want to go .
I want to return to my apartment building Treadway Hall .
Oh just walk down this road , take the first turning on the Left then walk 4 blocks and you'll find your building .
Thank you , sir .
No problem , actually you can take the subway and get off at 64th Street .
I see . But I'd rather walk .
Where are we .
I always seem to get lost in a new place .
I think we're somewhere near look .
There's a Policeman let's go and ask him the way .
All right . Excuse me , sir . Can you tell us how to get to Central Park .
Yes , go straight along this street for about 300 yards . Then when you come to a bridge walk across it and turn left after you turn walk for another 6 or 7 minutes and then .
Well , I don't think we'll be able to remember all that .
By the way , is it possible to go there by bus .
Yes , but it doesn't go directly to the park .
You have to change buses at least TWICE better take the subway instead . It's much less complicated that way and much quicker .
That's a good idea . Where is the nearest subway station .
About a block down from here I'm going in that Direction Come With Me . I'll show you where it is .
Thanks a lot .
Pardon me Can you tell me where the big hen supermarket is .

You can't miss it .
Thanks . I really appreciate your help .
Young man , I couldn't help but overhear your conversation just now .

Good afternoon .
Will you please tell me how to get to NW 5 .
Do you want to go there by bus or by tube .
By Tube .
Sorry , I don't know what tube means .
The tube is the Underground . Don't you know .
The Americans call it the subway .
Oh I se .
You mean the underground railway .
Yes we Londoners , call it the Tube .
You haven't been in London long have yo .
No I got here . Only today , about half an hour ago .
Good heavens .
You mustn't take the Tube then .
Why not .
For a stranger here the London tube could be a maze .
You know what a maze is don't you .
Yes it's labyrinth .
But I'm in a maze already without going down to the tube .
In that case , you'd better take the bus to be on the safe side .
By the way , what's the difference between a bus and a coach .
Buses are double-deckers , as a rule .
See that one going down the street .
That's a typical London bus .
As for coaches they are mostly long distance vehicles with soft seats more comfortable than double-deckers .
You've made it very clear . Thank you .
Now will you tell me how to get to NW 5 by bus .
Let me see , it's a bit complicated , so just listen to me carefully please .
All right . Go ahead .
First you cross the road . Take the second turn on the left , walk about 10 yards down a narrow lane and you'll find yourself at another busy street .
Then turn to the right just walk straight ahead passing 2 or 3 blocks and you'll find the number 82 bus stop just outside a big department store .
When you're on the bus . Ask the conductor to put you down at Oxford Circus .
That's where you change onto a number 19 bus it'll take you to northwest London .
Would that be NW 5 .
I can't tell you .
But you'll be somewhere near it I guess .
You only guess .
I thought a policeman should be sure with his answer when he's asked for information .
But I belong to the police station of the West End .
How could I know the bus routes in all the other parts of the city .
I'm not the map of London , Miss .
I mustn't blame you .
It's such a big city .
But are you clear about what I've just told you .
Do I have to say it again .
No , don't bother to repeat it .
From what you've told me already I gather . London is a big maze not only under the ground but also on the ground .
So I've made up my mind to take a taxi after all .
Thank you very much . All the same .
.
It would certainly be the safest way .
Let me call a taxi for you .
Taxi .
Excuse me , could you tell me where the post office is .
Go straight ahead and then turn right .
Thank you very much .
My pleasure .
Excuse me . But is this the way to the Grand Hotel .
Yes it is .
Is it far .

Yes , just go straight till you reach a crossroad then turn right and walk until you see a 20-story Building the movie theater is just next TO it you can't miss it .
Thank you very much . How far is it from here .
Not too far about a 20 minute wal .
Can I take a bus there .
I'm afraid there's no bus going that direction .
Excuse me . I wonder if you can tell me how to find a place where I can have my shoes fixed .
I'm new in town .
Well , of COURSE , you can always look in the Yellow Pages under shoe-repair . But I think there is a good shop , not far from here .
Take the first street to the left and walk about 3 blocks .
I can't remember the name of the shop .
But you'll run into it .
It's near the police station .

London is such a big place and I'm from the East End .
Why don't you go and ask a cop .
Pardon What's a cop .
Don't you know what a cop is .
It's another name for the policeman .
But for goodness sake don't call any of them cop to his face .
Why not .
It's slang , you see .
They are referred to as cops only behind their backs .
Thank you for reminding me .
Are there any policemen in the London streets .
There always seem to be quite a lot about when you don't need them , but when you want to call the police . Guess what happens .
I suppose when you want to call the police . None of them can be found .
Am I right .
.
That's exactly what I was going to say and you took it right out of my mouth .
Clever girl .
But how did you know .
All the policemen in the world are like that , aren't they .
Yes , you're absolutely right .
Are you Chinese Deary .
Now it's my turn to ask , How do you know .
A little bird told me .
Look .
There's a cop at the Corner go and ask him before he walks away .
Be quick .
Thanks a lot .
Bye .
Excuse me , but could you tell me how to get downtown .
Yes of course .
Are you familiar with the streets around here .
No .
I came from Taiwan . Only a week ago .
Well then , I'll show you the way .
Oh no .
That's too much trouble for you .
Just tell me the shortest way to get there .
No trouble at all .
I'm going downtown myself .
Is it far from here .
No .
It's only 3 or 4 blocks away .
Pardon me sir .
Can you tell me how to get to the Imperial Theater .
I seem to have gotten lost .
There are many ways to get to the Imperial Theater .
Oh please tell me the fastest way .
I'm very late , as it is .
Well in that case , keep going straight , and when you get to the second stop light cross the street and turn left .
Walk about 3 blocks and you'll see the Imperial Theater on the right .
It's a big building so you can't miss it .
Of course there is a short cut but if you're not acquainted with America . It may turn out to be longer . In the end .
Oh , I think I understand .
Thank you .
Let's see , go straight ahead and turn left at the first stop light or was it right after the second stop light .
Oh dear .

That's very easy the exit is always open .
Thank you very much .
My pleasure .
What's the best time to take the subway .
Try to avoid the rush hour since peak hours are prime time for pickpockets and you might not get a seat easily during the peak hours .
Should I buy a token each time .
Not necessarily .
If you want to save time and money you can buy a monthly pass or buy many tokens at one time for future use .
I'm sorry to trouble You . I'm looking for the nearest subway entrance here .
I don't blame you the subway entrances can be difficult to find .
You go down this way and walk for about 5 minutes then you'll see a big book store on your Right the subway station is just next to it .
You can't miss it because you'll notice the people flow there .
Let's go to Chinatown by bus .

Okay . It will be a new experience for me too .
We have a rather comprehensive subway system HERE . You can get almost anywhere rather quickly on a subway , especially at this time of day , when the traffic is heavy .
Where do we pay the fare .
Just give the man standing there one dollar and he'll give you a token .
Then you slip it into the slot at the turnstile and push the turnstile to get in .
Let me pay for it .
Where can I get a subway map .
Ask the worker who sells tokens to give you One it's free of charge .
Actually maps showing subway routes are posted at most stations .
Do I have to pay an additional fare to change trains .
No , you don't have to .
Here comes the train .
Be careful subway doors open and close automatically .
Well , it's not as crowded as we expected , isn't it .
No , but it will be soon .

How did you enjoy your subway trip yesterday Mr. Li .
Very much and I found it very funny too .
Really .
When did you take your trip there .
I was down at the Lilan station at 7:30 , I guess that was a bad time to travel . When a train pulled in . I was simply swept in by the rush of people from behind .
Oh poor you .
But did you manage to find a seat .
That was out of the question .
The train left the station . Before I was able to get back my breath .
I planned to get off at the Bridge station for a visit , but I found myself landed at an entirely new one .
So you overrode your station .
That's right . And it took me half an hour to get on a train back .
Excuse me . Officer Can you help me .
Sure .

The rest are all certificates .
But you still have to fill in an application form .
Here you are .
You can take them home to fill out if you like .
Thank you .
How long do I have to wait for the visa .
We'll send your papers to the immigration office right away , but it usually takes months , even years to get a reply .
But I must get there in the summer vacation before the autumn term starts .
Couldn't you ask the immigration office to grant the visa as soon as possible .
Don't worry .
Foreign students all get their visas in time .
It's people who might want to make a living in Britain that we try to stop .
Yes I can quite understand .
You have your unemployment problems and all that .
I can assure you the whole purpose of my going over to study is to come back afterwards to do my bit in the modernization of China .
Well , are there any other formalities .
No , not for the moment .
I'll let you have the forms by tomorrow morning .
See you tomorrow .
Good morning .
Hello . Miss Li .
I'm so glad to see you .
Oh no you aren't .
I've been here . Hundreds of times for the visa so you couldn't possibly be glad to see me again .
But I'm really glad to see you this morning .
I was just going to ring you up to let you know the visa had been granted at last .
Really .
I can hardly believe my ears .
Do you realize I've been waiting for nearly 6 months by now .
Actually that's not very long compared with the time it took many other visa appliers .
I told you long ago that it might take a long time . Didn't I .
Yes , now I see what you mean .
This is British efficiency , I suppose .
No , let's not put it that way , please .
Shall we say , it's the efficiency of the British immigration office .
The trouble with them is they seem to think anyone who goes to Britain will stay put there .
But Miss Li with so many immigrants in Britain already . The immigration office has to take precautions . You know .
To be frank , if I were somebody who wanted to stay abroad for good . I would certainly not choose Britain .
Why not .
I should think England is a rather nice place to live in with its mild weather . Not very cold in winter and never too hot in summer .
As far as I know the living cost there is very high . While the Sweden and many other western countries .
That I must admit is true .
Besides England is well known for its bad weather .
I hear the sun hardly ever shines there .
Yes we have maritime climate in the British Isles .
It can't be helped .
If I wanted to have a good TIME . I wouldn't like to live in England either .
In that case , would you go to New York instead of London .
Yes , or Paris or Venice or Vienna .
What puzzles me now my dear young lady is why you should have applied for a British visa after all .
Oh , the answer is quite simple . I happen to be a student of English you see .
And I've always wanted to get an MA degree in English Language in England since my school days .
If I may say so . Miss Li , you must have been a most ambitious girl .
Yes , I was .
In fact I still am .
As I'm so determined to get that degree , I've decided to go to London University .
I see .
No wonder you speak such fluent English .
Thank you .
Now you see why I must go to England , even if it rained everyday there .
Well , you could go to America for the degree to learn American English see .
And I wouldn't like to speak with an American accent .
The reason is very simple . Again , I just don't want to learn American English see .
And I wouldn't like to speak with an American accent .
But nowadays . Quite a lot of people all over the world prefer to speak with an American accent .
It seems to have become a rather smart accent , especially among young people .
Haven't you noticed it .
Yea , I'm a smart girl that speaks with a smart accent .
Ain't you a smart guy , too . Mr. Cowboy .
You bet .
To tell you the truth . The American accent gives me pins and needles sometimes .
The Americans seem to speak through their noses . While I prefer speaking with my mouth .
How strange . I thought the English spoke with their tongues . That's why they are so proud of the English Tongue isn't that so .
How strange .
I thought the English spoke with their tongues . That's why they are so proud of the English Tongue isn't that so .
I say with you puns and your big vocabulary you'll make a great linguist , to be sure .
Well , here is your passport and the visa is stamped on one of the pages .
Thank you very much .
Good morning .
What can I do for you .
But you've been here recently , haven't you .
Yes , I was here only yesterday morning .
My name is Sun Lin .
Here are the forms you gave me to fill out and I've done it .
Are you all right I wonder .
Thank you .
Let's have a look . Yes they are properly done .
That's good . I'll send them to London with the rest of your papers .
I must go now .
Thank you for your help . During the last 6 months .
6 months .
Gosh .
Does one have to wait as long as all that .
Yes , I'm afraid . So , and sometimes even longer than that .
But if also have to wait for such a long time , the term will have started long before I get to London .
That would be too bad .
Couldn't you do something about it .
As I've told you already . I'm not in the position to promise anyone anything .
All I can say IS : foreign students would get visas in time if they apply for them in time .
Good .
That's all I wanted to know .
Now Miss Li , you can go and get your yellow paper ready for the journey .
Excuse me what's yellow paper .
It's just another name for a health certificate .
You too will have to be inoculated for the yellow paper when you've got the visa .
If you have any other questions . Just ask Miss Li .
She's a walking dictionary .
Really .
Miss Li must be a great scholar then .
No , not quite .
She's just a very smart Chinese girl .
Good morning , What can I do for you .

If you are flying . For the first time several things may happen to you during the flight , which you should not worry about .
The noise you hear before taking off is from the engines warming up .

If your ears pop it is the atmospheric pressure , and the problem can be solved by swallowing hard .
You may also notice an increase in engine noise after landing .
This is because the engine reverse thrust system is used to slow the plane .

In the English-speaking countries like the United States and Canada . Do not ever address a stranger by Comrade or master .
And it is not always appropriate to call a man sir and woman Madam or miss because the situation in which you meet them may not be the same .

In asking directions try not to have it repeated more than once .

In some countries sand is put under the sleepers to cut down the noise .

Never refuse stamps if they are offered because your English friends will be very grateful for them .

Although all houses should have a street number . Many are known only by a name .
If you have difficulty in finding such a house . Try asking the local shopkeepers or better still the postman if you are lucky enough to see him .
If you know that someone lives in a certain road but you do not know which number ask at the public library or police station and they will check on the electoral roll .
This is a road by road list of all the people entitled to vote .

I'd like to mail this letter to New York .
Mr. Tang , what are the famous historical spots in Shanghai .
The Jade Buddha Temple and the Yuyuan Garden .
What is special about the Jade Buddha Temple .
It was built in 1882 and houses 2 white jade statues of Skamania from burma We will visit it tomorrow .
And what is the Yuyuan Garden famous for .
This 400-year-old garden is famous for its ingenious architecture and exotic layout .
It was originally the private garden of Pan Yunduan governor of Sichuan in the Ming Dynasty .
The layout of the pavilions terraces rockeries and ponds shows great originality in affording wide views in a small confined space .
Buildings in the garden are ornamented with fine brick designs and wood carvings characteristic of the Southern architectural style of the Ming and Qing Dynasties .
When do we visit it .
The day after tomorrow .
What other programs have you arranged for us .
After a visit to the Yuyuan Garden in the morning . We will take a walk along the Nanjing Road , which is a prosperous commercial street similar to the famous 5th Avenue of New York City .
In the evening . We will take an evening boat trip along the Huangpu river .
Excellent .
Thank you very much for such a full and interesting itinerary .
Would you please wait for a minute .
I'll buy the tickets .
All right .
Here are your tickets .
Thank you .
Attention PLEASE The time of sightseeing is 4 hours we will meet at The Theatre at 5:30 . Is that okay .
Yes , that's okay .
Then let's go in .
It is a new park , isn't it .
Yes it was opened last year .
Why is it called Window of the World .
Well , generally speaking , the park is a window on the world history . A window on the world civilization and a window on the world's tourist attractions as well .
Oh how wonderful .
It is a place of the marvelous sights of the world natural landscapes folklore and social customs as well as ethnic Songs and Dances it is an absolutely fantastic World where tourists can find much pleasure .
Oh that's great .
This is the World Square . That is the area of Asia . This is the area of Europe . That is the area of America .
That's beautiful .
In the evening at about 7 o'clock a drama will be put on at the theater in the park .
Oh , I am afraid it will be a hard time for me .
I can't understand a single Chinese word .
Don't worry , it is a dance drama .
The characters in the drama will dance throughout the play .
The aside will be spoken in English and Chinese .
So you needn't worry about the language . I think you will have a good time this evening .
That is great .
Look , this is the famous World Trade Center .
It's huge , isn't it .
Yes it is .
Would you like to go to the top and have a bird's eye view of the city .
Why of course .
Where can we take the elevator .
This way , please .
Oh . We're in the sky .
The view is so breathtaking .
Which is the best way approaching the Great Lakes .
Well , we should get on board a ship and start from the Lake Ontario .
Lake Ontario .
Yes .
It's the smallest of the Great Lakes . But it's deep with a maximum sounding of 802 feet .
Compared with the other lakes Ontario is more elusive .
Is the famous Niagara Falls there .
Yes .
Its sheer thunderous drop has been an elusive barrier between the Ontario and other lakes .
But the Erie Lake is the one that people talk about a lot .
That's because it's a killer of small draft .
It has a reputation for treacherous flash storms .
How about others .
Superior is the worst storm lake Lake Huron is the second largest of the Lakes and Lake Michigan is the only one of the lakes that is entirely within the US .
This is Westminster Abbey .
It's one of the oldest buildings in London and in its architecture , you will recognize different styles .
Busts and monuments , remind us of William Shakespeare Walter Scott and many others .
To the left you see the Houses of Parliament with the famous clock tower , Big Ben .
In the building , there is the House of Commons and the House of Lords .
There to the left you see a small street called Downing Street .
Number 10 , the last of its 10 houses has always been the residence of the British prime minister .
Now we're approaching Trafalgar Square .
This is Tower Bridge . The most striking of all London Bridges .
Look .
The bridge is parting in the middle and the 2 halves are moving upwards . A big steamer is passing underneath .
Down river stretch the London Docks .
Where . Shall we go today Mr. Peng .
Are there any places of historical interest here .
Yes , there are few and most of them are not very old .
But I really like to recommend Guangxiaosi temple .
I've heard of it .
Is it very far .
No .
We can walk there in about 20 minutes .
It is one of the oldest sights in Guangzhou .
Local legend has it that it existed even before the city was established .
Sounds very interesting and it must be worth a visit .
Now let's see the aviary first .
All right .
Look , a pair of eagles from North America .
Huge birds , aren't they .
And so , stately .
What are those repulsive looking birds of prey in the cage beside them .
They're hawks buzzards and vultures .
They are vicious looking creatures .
Look at the Falcons .
Look at the Peacock it is beautiful .
So proud and so beautiful .
Well , look at the turkeys swans and ducks .
Let's go nearer .
We'd better go and see the carnivorous animals .
Just feast your eyes on that majestic lion prancing about its cage .
He seems fully aware of being the King of Beasts .
Those sleek leopards are very fascinating .
I've seldom seen such beautiful furs .
Oh , here are the Jackals wolves and wild cats .
What a horrible moaning noise they're making .
Those white and black giant pandas are gentle and lovable thoug .
This is the snake alley that we told you about .
Hey , there are a lot of foreigners here This is certainly a popular sightseeing spot .
It's one of the oldest areas of the city .
I'd like to show you one of the snake shops .
Why is eating snakes so popula .
Well , it's not the meat that is so popular . It's the blood .
Come on . Let's give it a try .
You want me to drink snake blood .
No way .
What's the matter .
Snake blood will make you more Energetic . It's good for your health .
This is certainly something to write home about .
All right , I'll try it .
Wow , look at how big that snake is .
Amazing .
The man is so skillful .
Do the sellers get bitten often .
Yes , but they become almost immune to the snake venom .
Look now he's cutting the snake open and putting the blood into those glasses .
Then people drink it right away .
Not Right away we can drink it after he mixes it with the wine .
Here .
Well you only live once .
Bottoms Up .
Not bad .
Later , we can try some snake meat .
If you like wine , we can get shrimp boiled in a wine soup that will knock you off your feet .
Let's look around more first .
What are some other possibilities around here .
There's the monkey show or we could see more snakes , or check out a Chinese medicine store .
What's Chinese medicine like .
It's Hard To Explain but the Chinese medicine stores here are also called herb stores because the medicine is mainly greens .
Shall we take a look .
Sure sounds interesting .
Alright . Let's get down to business .
Here We Are : This is the Taipei Palace Museum .
What are you especially interested in seeing .
It's hard to say .
In fact I know very little about Chinese art and history , but can you give me some details about this building .
It's built in the classical Chinese style with a curved roof .
What are those small statues on the roof .
In the old days . They were used to cover the nails that held the roof together because roofs were made of wood .
Nowadays the statues are just for decoration .
That's the same style roof as on the concert hall . Right .
It seems like I've seen it before .
Right .
They're the same style , but as you can see the colors are different .
The Palace Museum is yellow , which stands for the emperor .
How did the Palace Museum get such a large collection .
This art collection was the emperors .
How old is the collection .
Some of the bronze pieces go back to the 17th century BC , but the collection itself was set up by the first emperor of the Sung dynasty over a thousand years ago .
Over a thousand years .
Incredible .
Let's go Inside . I can't wait to check it out .
Okay .
You know most of the collection here was put together during the Ching Dynasty .
So what do you think .
I was impressed with the landscape paintings and all the Jade carvings .
That jade cabbage just can't be beat .
Yeah . The colors were very realistic and it was so carefully carved .
What else did you like .
I really liked the calligraphy . I wish I could understand what it said the writing was beautiful .
I'm glad you enjoyed it .
Shall we go somewhere to enjoy ourselves .
Where . Shall we go .
How about Monterey Park .
That sounds good .
We haven't been to those places yet .
The Chinese community is quite worthy of a visit .
I know virtually nothing about Monterey Park .
I don't know much about it myself , but I've heard about it .
More than 20 years ago , many Chinese Americans mostly from Hong Kong , Taiwan and other places moved out of Chinatown and started to establish a new residential and business center there .
They say there are many big supermarkets bookshops almost everything is available in the city .
An ideal place for a weekend visit and shopping trip .
I have a friend who lives somewhere near the city we can ask him to be our guide and go with us .
It would be very good if he could go with us .
Excuse me , how long can I keep these books .
One month .
Can I keep them longer .
Yes , but you have to renew them .
Fine , thank you .
I'd like to return these books .
Let me see .
These books are 2 weeks overdue . I'm sorry , you have to pay a fine .
How much .
Just a minute . Please .
Let me check .
Oh , it comes to $3 altogether .
Here are $5 .
Here is the receipt and your change .
You seem to read The China Daily every day , don't you .
Yes , I want to know what's happening in the world .
Which column is your favorite .
The news column of course .
By the way . Where can I find the back issues of The Times .
I'm sorry , I don't know .
You'd better ask the librarians for help .
All right , thank you . Just the same .
Can I help you .
Yes , I would like to apply for a library card .
Have you ever had a library card here before .
No I moved here last week .
I see .
Here's an application form .
Please read the instructions and fill out the form .
Here you are .
Anything else .
Good but I also need to have a look at your driver's license name , address and telephone number .
Please wait a minute , your new library card will be ready in no time .
Thank you .
Can I help you .
Yes , I'd like to borrow a copy of expressions in English conversation .
Sorry all the copies have been checked out .
Oh that's very disappointing .
Could you recommend any book of spoken English .
Certainly .
How about a dictionary of spoken English .
Okay , I'll take it .
Do you like to read romantic stories .
Not much I prefer detective stories to romantic ones because I find them more exciting and interesting .
What kind of books do you usually borrow besides those .
I also enjoy science books .
You are a science student , aren't you .
Yes , I am .
Why Tom see you again here .
Yes , I want to borrow the newly-published biography of President Clinton .
I came yesterday but didn't find any .
Did you ask the librarian to reserve .
Yes .
That's why I've come again today .
You won't be disappointed . This time .
I don't think I will .
Is that the famous St Paul's Cathedral .
Yes .
Although City skyscrapers now tower over St Paul's none of these new buildings has the dignity and presence of Christopher Wren's baroque church .
It seems to preside over London , like a benevolent spirit .
It's said that St Paul's Cathedral is the only English cathedral built between the Reformation , and the late 19th century .
Yes , it's also exceptional that it took 35 years to complete the construction .
Now we are entering from the West End .
And inside there is an unbroken Vista down the full length of the church .
From the back of the nave you would see the marble alter designed by Stephen dykes Brower .
Where is the Whispering Gallery .
It's on the south side .
A whisper against the wall is said to be clearly audible over 100 feet away across the void .
What a great scene .
Yes .
I've never seen such a crowded beach as Santa Monica .
People of all professions and age groups come here every summer on the weekends .
It's a time for fun and relaxation .
That's an important part of modern Americans' lives .
They like to go to the beach in the summer , especially people who live in big cities .
These vacationers come here with their friends or families .
Would you please , do me a favor .
Yes .
Could you take a photo of me here .
Certainly .
Thank you .
What shall I do .
This is an automatic one you press this button .
All right .
Step Forward A Little Say Cheese .
Thank you very much .
Not at all .
I've never expected the Eiffel Tower to be so magnificent .
It's a pity we've not got enough time to visit it today .
It is one of the single most recognizable structures in the world .
It weighs about 7,000 tons but exerts the same pressure on the ground as an average size person sitting in a chair .
That is a miracle . Indeed .
It was designed by Alexander Eiffel wasn't it .
You are quite right .
His fame rested mainly on his iron bridge .
He was also the designer of the Statue of Liberty .
Really .
He was something .
The tower is 1,056 feet high .
On a fine day you can see it . Some 40 miles away .
For years it remained the tallest man-made structure on earth until such skyscrapers as the Empire State Building surpassed it .
I guess people must have offered their admiration to Eiffel for his pioneering contribution .
Initially artists and writers vehemently denounced the tower although later generations sang its praise .
It was once called a giraffe the world's greatest lamppost . The iron monster .
Some nature lovers feared it would interfere with the flight patterns of birds over Paris .
I didn't know that .
Of course I have included it in my itinerary .
To see it best You had better visit it gradually .
How .
You can visit the Tower in 3 stages .
First , you can take the elevator to the first landing there , you have a view over the rooftops of Paris .
And then you come to the second landing The second landing provides a panoramic look at the city .
The 3rd and final stage gives the most spectacular view You'd better not go to the top landing directly .
I see .
What can I see within the tower .
There's so much for you to visit .
For example , on the 3rd level you can visit , Eiffel's office .
In the office , you can see wax figures depicting the engineer receiving Thomas Edison .
That's fabulous .
Tomorrow morning I'll get up early and visit it first .
But the tower won't be open until 9 .
How beautiful a view .
It sure is .
The Grand Canyon is truly a masterpiece .
No man could ever make anything like this .
What is that below .
It is the Colorado River .
You can go down the river in a boat . If you wish .
No thank you . It looks a bit too dangerous for me .
There is a beautiful state park here .
I can see why so many people come out here to camp .
Yes , there is this beautiful view , you can go fishing , camping , and also enjoy this beautiful clean air .
It definitely is a nice change from the polluted and crowded city .
Excuse me . Dr. Steward , I wonder if I could talk with you about my paper .
Yes of course .
When is good .
Will you be free this afternoon say from 3 to 4 .
Now let me check my schedule .
Okay . You could come to my office , then .
I'd like to fix an appointment with the principal .
Would 9 tomorrow be all right .
I'm afraid not .
He's got rather a full day tomorrow .
Could I make it a quarter to one .
Sorry again but I'll ring you if somebody cancels .
Do you think I could see the president sometime this morning .
Sorry he's fully booked this morning .
How about tomorrow morning .
Yes . Tomorrow morning should be fine .
Good afternoon .
This is the registry office isn't it .
Yes .
Good afternoon .
Have you come to register .
Of course .
I'm sorry to say it's a bit too late .
We were just going to close up .
Would you come tomorrow instead .
But I've come all the way from China , you know .
I arrived in London . Only an hour or 2 ago and came here straight from the airport .
So you're from China , that's a very long way away , I must say .
You are among the last batch of students to check in .
I could have come earlier . If there hadn't been the visa problem .
The British Home Office was to blame for that .
Well that's a long story .
Anyhow , I'm here to check-in now .
Where is your luggage .
I left it at the airport on purpose so as to get here before you close up for the day .
So here I am , just in time .
You are not going to shut the door on my face . Are you .
No , I wouldn't dream of doing such a thing to anyone . Straight from the other side of the globe .
Your name , please .
I just want to know your surname . So I can look it up in the register .
Li it's spelt with 2 letters only L and I .
Let me see l I .
.
Here it is .
But the other name happens to be Li as well .
Have we got it right .
Yes , it's absolutely correct .
Female 24 Chinese single post graduate English literature . Right .
Yes , that's me . All right .
Good .
Would you sign here .
Now just put down the date , please .
Thank you .
Is that all .
Yes . As far as checking in is concerned .
You know when the term begins , don't you .
You will look at when the term begins won't you .
It tells you where post-graduates should go on the first day of the term .
I'll look at the notice board in a minute .
I'm more anxious to know where I should go today .
Will you tell me where the women's dormitories are .
But there is no dormitory in this university .
Not in the campus .
Dormitory .
Campus .
You sound as if you had landed in America instead of England .
What are you laughing at .
I don't get it .
You see Miss Li students in this university don't live in dormitories they stay in hostels or boarding houses as a rule . If they don't have homes in London .
I was told this afternoon that London University was all over the city .
Is that so .
Yes . The university buildings are scattered in London .
Where Shall I stay for the night , then .
Mrs. Dobbs is the person in this office who helps newcomers with accommodation but she'd gone home long before you walked in .
I'm afraid you'll have to spend the night in a hotel .
I know what we can do , will you please ring her up for me .
I want to ask her where I could be put up for the night .
I'm sure she'll be glad to help somebody who's come all the way from China .
Okay here is Lake Itasca , the true source of the Mississippi .
Yes .
Help me take down the canoe and our exploring can begin .
But the river at that point is only about 10 feet wide , we can get into trouble there .
Maybe This is the true exploration .
Thanks heavens we pass it successfully .
Look the disjointed stone bridge blocks our way .
I think we have to pull the canoe out beat a passage through the prickly bush and carry the canoe around to the stream below the bridge .
The River loops back and forth upon itself , it has tripled or quadrupled the distance to our object .
Don't worry .
The River will leave the swamp and become straight soon .
Oh , great .
Here we reach the Benmidji Lake .
The river becomes a noble stream of 200 feet wide .
We begin a 400 mile delightful canoe trip tomorrow morning .
Have you visited Niagara Falls .
For several times .
It has become a tired old tourist site .
But if you look at it from an airplane it becomes something completely new .
Really .
Yes .
You should realize that Niagara Falls is not tired only the way of looking is tired .
You are all right .
For the ground tourist the approach to Niagara is flat and since an industrial area has grown up around the falls , they are surrounded by concrete asphalt and a strong chemical smell on both the United States and Canadian sides .
Only a stretch of lawn and trees reminds us of the wilderness that once was there .
Can we see its real face at altitude .
Of course .
So I think we should visit it again .
Thank you very much .
You're welcome .
Let's get off the bus . Ladies and gentlemen .
This is Zhangjiajie .
We can take some time to go around .
Please go back to the bus at 4 o'clock .
What a beautiful scenery .
Yes , it's really a nice place .
The mountains have gradually eroded to form a peculiarly spectacular landscape of peaks and huge rock columns rising out the forest .
There are waterfalls caves streams everywhere .
This place is unique .
This is Jiangjun Cliff on the right , it is Yuanyang waterfall .
Oh , look at the people there , they are dressed differently .
Oh , they are people of the minority group Tujia .
This area is home to 3 of the province's minority peoples Tujia Miao and Bai .
These minority groups continue to speak their language and maintain their traditional culture .
I see .
On the way up . It is jumping fish pool .
It is so beautiful .
Did you enjoy yourself .
Yes , I had a great day .
It is nearly 4 o'clock now we'd better go back to the bus .
All right , let's go .
Look at this ramp .
It was cut out from a complete slab and weighs 250 tons .
It's really huge .
What's unusual about it is that without the modern machinery , the people 500 years ago , managed to move such a monster from Fangshan all the way here .
Where is Fangshan .
About 100 kilometers southwest of Beijing .
It's a miracle .
How did they do it .
They dug a well every 500 meters and built an ice road by pouring the well water on the road in cold winter .
Then they placed the slab on a huge sledge and pulled it all the way here .
Truly resourceful .
I wish we could stay here longer . But there is so much more to see .
So shall we do it fast and get to the Inner Court quickly .
By all means .
Well , this is the end of the tour .
You must be a bit tired after all this walking and standing .
That's all right .
I've enjoyed everything you showed me .
I'm glad to hear that .
Okay . We still have some TIME Would you like to do some shopping on our way back to the hotel .
I'd love to .
Good . Let's go .
Taxi .
I suppose this is an emperor's throne .
Yes .
Looks imposing but I'm afraid . I'd feel more comfortable sitting in the armchair back in my office .
I agree with you .
This is Zhonghe Dian or the hall of Central harmony .
The emperor used to take a rest in this Hall on his way to the Hall of supreme harmony .
He also met his cabinet members here .
This is Baohe Dian or the hall of preserving harmony .
Every 3 years , the emperor held a palace examination in this hall for scholars pursuing high literary degrees .
What was the purpose of such examination .
For the emperor such examination was a tool for selecting senior officials to serve his dynasty .
For the examinees passing the exam meant guaranteed high position and great credit to the family .
What a riot of color there is with all kinds of flowers in blossom .
Do you see those red white and yellow roses blooming by the fountain .
What are those small yellow and white flowers sprouting up on the lawn .
The yellow ones are buttercups and the white ones are daisies .
I wonder why they weren't planted in proper flower beds .
They look more natural peeping up out of the grass like that .
Aren't those Azalea bushes beautiful .
Yes .
Here's an interesting bed with a mixture of daffodils violets lilies of the valley and bluebells .
By the way , do you know much about how to grow flowers .
Oh , not much .
But my mother grows a lot at my home .
It takes plenty of time to take care of them .
Of course .
You've to water them and see that they get enough bright sunlight .
It really takes a lot of knowledge .
What place are you going to show us today .
We are going to climb Wudangshan Mountains .
Oh how wonderful .
Here we are .
Wudangshan Mountains stretch for 400km across northwestern Hubei province .
They are a range to the Taoists and a number of Taoist temples were built here .
Oh that's great .
This is Tianzhu peak the highest summit of the mountains .
What is the meaning of Tianzhu in Chinese .
Heavenly pillar . It means a pillar propping up the sky .
That's sounds exciting .
I love european parks and gardens .
Greenwich Park is lovely , but the observatory is really interesting .
You can stand astride the Greenwich Meridian 0 line and have one foot in the western hemisphere and one foot in the eastern .
That'll be fun must take a photo .
Look , everybody . Have you noticed the Houses of Parliament behind us and Westminster Abbey .
Yes a most interesting place .
All the kings and queens of England have been crowned there .
Yes , except Edward V , Edward VIII .
And many famous men are buried there including kings and poets .
Yes indeed .
Oh , we must be approaching the heart of the city now .
There's the Nat West Towe .
Yes , it's the tallest building in the UK now .
Now we are just coming up to London bridge next we're coming to the Tower of London .
Oh splendid .
What a sight .
Look .
The water of the Lijiang River is so clear and pure .
Yes . The reflections of the hills in the water looks so real and the farmlands spread out like green carpets .
Fantastic .
I feel as if in a wonderland .
The landscape in Guilin is characterized by its green hills clear water pretty rocks and grotesque caves .
I hear it's a fascinating experience to visit the caves .
As planned , we will visit some famous caves right .
Yes .
In the caves you'll see splendid stalactites stalagmites Stone curtains and flowers .
They form various fascinating scenes .
There .
The Hill looks like an elephant .
I remember seeing it somewhere .
It is the elephant trunk HILL It looks like an elephant drinking water with its long trunk .
What a beautiful sculpture of nature .
Look at those bamboo rafts over there with men and Big Birds .
The birds are busy catching fish .
The birds are trained cormorants .
The boat is going faster now .
Yes .
Pretty soon we'll see the Huashan Hill .
What's special about it .
It's another wonder along the Lijiang River .
Seen from some distance away the different shades in color on the cliff appear like a herd of horses .
Please call my attention when we are there .
You can count on it .
As palaces go I think the grandiose building facing down the Mall is neither old nor attractive .
In fact , the palace's best facade Nash's long garden front only can be enjoyed by those invited to one of her Majesty's garden parties .
But how about us .
We have to wait .
Wait .
Yes .
When the trees are bare . We can see it from the top of the double deck bus heading down Gloucester place .
What a pity it is .
But you can also get a glimpse of Nash's architecture by visiting the Royal Mews in Buckingham Palace Road .
Really .
Yes , it is also designed by Nash .
What are the best places to visit here please .
It depends .
If you are interested in the city , you might like to tour it by car .
I can be your guide .
We'll leave the afternoon free .
You can do some shopping in the shopping mall . If you like .
Great .
What do you suggest we see .
I suggest we visit the Metropolitan Museum of Art first .
Now let's go .
Look , people are jogging along the river .
Here we are .
The exhibits are really special .
I enjoy the paintings , very much .
This is Broadway .
There are lots of theaters .
This Way leads to Times Square .
Every New Year's Eve , thousands of New Yorkers and visitors welcome in the New Year here .
And we should not miss seeing Greenwich Village a little west of Washington Square .
Hello Mr. Liang .
Could you do me a favor .
Yes , what can I do for you .
As I'm a stranger here could you accompany me on a tour round the famous Yuexiu Park .
Certainly , I'll be glad to .
Here we are in the Yuexiu Park , Mr. Williams .
It is the largest park in the city .
Shall we go and see the Zhenhai Tower first .
Good .
Oh , it's a very imposing tower with red walls and green tiles in the typical Chinese architectural style .
Yes , it is also known as the 5-story tower built in the Ming Dynasty .
It now houses the Museum of Guangzhou .
When we go up to the top floor at the balcony . You can have a bird's eye view of the whole city of Guangzhou .
Very interesting .
Mr. Williams , this is the famous 5 Goat statue , the symbol of Guangzhou .
Our city is also known as the City of goats .
I think you've heard this name .
Yes . And there is a beautiful story behind this name .
I've read about this from a book .
This statue is really a magnificent piece of art .
Yuexiu Park offers a nice combination of both charming scenery and cultural activities .
In this park , there are a grand stadium swimming pools artificial lakes a roller-skating court and a special playground for children .
Shall we have a look at all these places .
Sure , I'll be delighted to do so .
You went to Disneyland yesterday , didn't you .
Yes , I did .
How did you like it .
Marvelous .
Every day people arrive there in a stream of cars and buses .
I have never seen such a crowded and charming resort .
Among these visitors , which is the biggest group , children , adults or old peopl .
Disneyland attracts people of all tastes and most income groups and people of all ages from toddlers to grandfathers .
What are the attractive features of Disneyland .
The central attraction of the Magic Kingdom , is a place of excitement and thrills , for everyone .
How long does a visit las .
That depends on how much you want to see .
You should have a map in hand so that you always know where you are .
What part of the visit excited you mos .
A stereoscopic film Grand Canyon .
That's really a special attraction .
Can you tell me something about Disneyland .
Sur .
Are you going to take a trip .
That's right .
I'll visit there with my wife , for a couple of days .
I've been there only once . But I'll tell you what I can remember .
When did you go there .
That's quite a few years ago .
I stayed there for 2 days .
Did you see much .
No , I just visited some important places .
You can't see all of the amusement park in one day .
How big is the park .
About 180 acres .
It has 5 main sections they're named Main Street Frontierland fantasyland Tomorrowland and Adventureland .
Disneyland is often called a magic kingdom .
There're so many things to see in the park .
What did you enjoy most .
Jungle River Boat Safari Sleeping Beauty Castle walkthrough Submarine Voyage and Tom Sawyer Island I think are all fascinating .
It sounds like you had a wonderful time .
Yes , it sure was a happy and memorable experience for me .
I'm sure you'll enjoy your visit too .
Look .
That's the famous parade of Walt Disney characters .
Wow .
Snow White and the 7 dwarfs . This is a true fairyland .
Look who's coming .
Oh Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck Lao Li , I'd like to have a picture taken with them .
Okay .
Get Ready cheese .
Great .
One more .
All right . One more .
Now shoot this one for me .
The one I took last time was blurred .
I'll take 3 shots for you .
So don't move .
ONE 2-3 there must be a good one .
Now , let's take the Jungle Cruise .
Such a line .
It'll take 10 to 15 minutes , but it's really worth it .
What's the cruise about .
You'll soon find out by yourself .
Oh , it's truly hair raising .
Was it not worth it .
Oh , of course .
That's another experience I can boast of when I'm back in China .
I was also scared to death , the first time I took the cruise , but I still like it .
People like to scare themselves sometimes .
I agree .
Well , what's next .
After such a horrible experience I'd suggest something sweet and romantic .
What about Snow White and the 7 Dwarfs .
Let's go .
It is a lovely day , isn't it .
Yes it IS : it is a lovely day for an outing .
What places of interest are you going to show us today .
We will go to splendid China first and then to Safari Park .
Splendid China .
Yes , it is a park It features all the man made and natural wonders of China in miniature .
Oh I see .
This park can enable us to tour the whole China just in one day .
Oh that's great .
Look .
The Great Wall stretches right into the sea .
Our forefathers built this wall to defend themselves from invasion .
That's why they had to make it so long over mountains and across plains from the land to the sea .
I see .
So the Great Wall was built for the sake of peace .
In that case , it should be called the Peace Wall .
That's not a bad idea , but it's a bit too late now .
You should have made this suggestion to the first Chinese emperor long ago .
When would that be .
You should have spoken to him about it in the Qin Dynasty , which was only a bit over 2000 years back .
I know I'm not young any longer , but not as old as all that .
Let's go up these steps .
It's a rather steep slope .
Will you give me your handbag and hold on to my arm .
Thank you .
As you know , the Westerners have completed many huge projects , but none of them beats this wall in scale .
The American astronauts saw it with their naked eyes from the moon , didn't they .
Yes . They saw a very small world and this long long wall .
Anyway the Western countries are advanced in science and technology .
That's why I'm going to London to study electronics .
I hope you'll bump into my daughter Rebecca when you are there .
If you come across a muddle headed girl . It may be her .
But there are so many students at london University . It's not very likely I should meet your daughter .
Oh you never can tell .
It's a small world . After all , just like what the astronauts saw from the moon .
Perhaps you are right .
Gosh .
Where is my bag .
It was in my hand . A few minutes ago .
Here you are my dear clear-headed professor .
You have visited Yellowstone already . Could you tell me something about this famous national park .
My pleasure .
The best part of Yellowstone lies in the northwest of Wyoming .
In 1872 it became the world's first national park .
It's said that Yellowstone is a wonderful land which has intrigued the minds of men and moved them inspired them .
Yes .
The wonder the mystery and the beauty of this plateau challenged the early explorers .
Here in Yellowstone were features of such significance that men were inspired to evolve a new philosophy for the land a new land use ethic based on preserving a part of the natural scene .
But to many , it is a fleeting glimpse of a geyser a bear or a canyon through the window of a passing car .
More than this .
When you visit it , you'll find that Yellowstone is more than a collection of scenic features and natural curiosities .
Can I help you .
Yes , I'd like to know what's playing for the next 2 weeks .
Yes . Let's see , on the 29th and 30th Friday and Saturday nights Dave Brubeck will be in town .
However , that's all sold out .
Then next Wednesday . Marcel Marceau will be doing a one nighter .
Are there any good seats left for his performance .
No .
I see Well , how about next Friday or Saturday .

At 6:30 PM .
Which seats . Would you suggest .
How many tickets . Do you need .

Yeah , 2 in the 10th row .
How much is the ticket .
$7.50 each .
Are there any good seats left .
I'm sorry . The tickets are sold out .
What a pity .
I'd like to book 2 seats for Swan Lake for Sunday evening .

I'd prefer 2 seats closer to the stage .
I'm sorry but I'm afraid . That's all we have .
I'd like to book 2 seats for tomorrow .
Would you like something in the front stalls .
I suppose there's nothing further back . Is there .

Looking good . Tom .
You can lift , a lot of weight .
How about 30 more kilos .
30 more .
No way .
I'm not Arnold Schwarzenegger .
What do you think of the facilities here .
Not bad .
Weight machines rowing machines sauna Hot Tub everything we need . I can't complain .
Let's go to the hot tub . We can talk more easily there .
Good idea .
Let's take a break I'm pretty tired after all this hard work .
Tom , we have a small problem with the factory work and I think you should know about it .
Go ahead I'm listening .
You know the price of oil has gone up , so it's more expensive to ship materials and because of that factory production costs have also gone up .
What are you getting at .
Well , we're going to have to raise our prices .
I'm afraid I'm not very happy about that . Howard . We've been doing business with you because your prices are more competitive than those in Korea and Hong Kong .
When it rains . We all get wet Tom .
Prices in Korea and Hong Kong have to go up as well .
That's true but maybe oil prices will go down soon .
I really don't believe they might go down very soon .
Wait , wait .
If we keep our prices low we could attract customers away from our competitors .
But that's impossible .
Even if bigger companies lower prices to fight us they'll be taking too big a CHANCE they won't last long , and neither will we .
We'll have to think about this some more .
Right now , I just want to relax .
Okay .
Let's settle this later at the office .
Who is it .
It's me , Olivia .
Oh is that you , Shirley .
Come in , please .
I haven't seen you for a long time .
How are things with you .
Fine .
And how are you and your mother .
Also good .
Thank you .
I've come to tell you my mother and I are going to the theater this coming Saturday .
Would you care to join us .
With the greatest pleasure Shirley .
It's very kind of you to invite me .
What's on that interests you .
Shakespeare's Romeo and Juliet .
It's being staged by a famous British theatrical troupe .
Wonderful .
By the way , will it be an evening performance or a matinee .
We want to see the first night performance .
That's great .
I also prefer an evening performance .
I'll let you know the exact time for the performance as soon as I get the tickets .
See you later .
Very well .
Goodbye .
How did you like the play Olivia .
I think the acting and the stage effects were all superb .
This is the most successful performance I've seen in recent years .
I am of the same mind .
I was so attracted by the marvelous acting that at times I completely forgot myself .
I've never seen an audience applaud so much before .
I think there were at least 4 curtain calls .
I know the story of the play well . Still , I was deeply moved by the denouement of the play .
I enjoyed every minute of the performance .
I'm awfully glad you enjoyed yourself .
Excuse me , is this seat taken .
Yes it is .
It is not my seat , then where is my seat .
Which row and Which Seat is your ticket .
It is Row C seat 9 .
You are mistaken your seat is not here it is on the right .

How did you like Haimei's singing .
She sang . Well , I thought .
She sang a popular song didn't she .
Yes , a very charming love song .
What type of music . Do you like best .
I like classical music best How about you .
I have a special liking for light music .
As I know American pop music is played all over the world and is enjoyed by all ages in many countries .
I wonder why it enjoys such great popularity .
The reasons for its popularity are its fast pace and rhythmic beat .
How is the night life in Guangzhou , Mike .
Very interesting .
What do you suggest then .
How about going to dance .
There is a very good nightclub nearby .
That's a fine IDEA let's go .
Oh the dance hall looks very nice and the music is wonderful .
I'm glad you like it .
The band is especially good at playing rock and roll .
That's great .
I love to dance to fast music .
Am I presentable .
You look terrific in that new dress .
Shall we get going .
Yes .
Let's go .
Shall we find a place to sit down and watch it for a while .
All right .
Let me get you a drink or something .
Thank you .
Is this the line for Grand Canyon .
Yes it is .
Do you always have to wait in line like this .
Yes . Especially when big movies are first released .
I hope I can get a good seat .
Don't worry .
This is a big theater and .
Do I have to dress formally .
Yes , you'd better dress up .
Do you think this dress would be okay .

How about later in the evening .
Oh yes the evening is better .
This is a list of the songs that have accompaniment here .
Do they use video cassettes or laser discs .
Laser discs .
That makes it easier to locate the songs . People want to sing .
Do they have English songs here .
Yes the names here are all written in English .
Oh they have yesterday here that's a song by The Beatles , I'll try it .
Just write the title of the song on that slip of paper . The host will come to collect it .
Miss Wang , would you like to have a try too .
How about this one . The Way We Were .
Oh no , I'm a poor singer .
My voice can't reach the high notes .
It Doesn't Matter , since they're using laser discs , here it is very easy to change the key You can just ask the host to lower the key .
Come on Miss Wang .
All right .
Thank you . Thank you .
Mr. Bush would you treat us to another song .
Okay .

They are doing a very hard and dangerous job It is really breathtaking .
Look at this Program It is funny and relaxing .
The clown is doing tightrope walking he is making faces to the audience .
It is not an easy job isn't it .
No . This would also take a lot of skill .

The 7th item is your second beer .

Either will do .
The bill is made out in Renminbi if you pay in US dollars . We'll convert renminbi into US dollars against today's exchange rate .
I see .
Here's your bill , sir .
It's 387 yuan and 4 Jiao altogether .
Please have a check on it .
Wow .
Nearly 400 yuan for a single meal .
If you wait a minute . Gentlemen , I'll go over the details .
You had one shark's fin soup . That's 80 yuan fried sea crab meat is 100 yuan . This 88 yuan is for fried prawns There are also roast Beijing duck vegetables and your drinks the service charge is also included . Of course .

I hope you enjoyed your dinner .
See you next time .
Could I have my bill please .
Certainly , sir .
.
I'm afraid . There has been a mistake .
I'm sorry , si .
What seems to be the trouble .
I believe you have charged me twice for the same thing .
Look , the figure of 17.50 yuan appears here then again her .
I'll just go and check it for you , sir .
Yes , sir . You are quite right .
The cashier made a mistak .
I think you will find it correct no .
Thank you .
We do apologize for that , sir .
That's right . No harm done .
Now , can I pay by traveller's checks .
Yes you can . Sir .
We'll give you the change in Renminbi if you don't mind .
You needn't worry about that there won't be much change out of $30 .
So you can keep the change .
That's very kind of you , Sir . But there is no tipping in China .
I'm sorry , I didn't know that .
You see , I just got in town yesterday from Boston .
No tipping .
That's good .
But just for curiosity's sake . How can you survive without tips .
Just as everybody else , you see we are paid the same monthly wages as everybody in the restaurant .
I see .
The reason I was wondering whether you could make a living without taking tips is that in my country waiters and waitresses are paid a much lower hourly pay than people in non tipping positions .
They expect the tips from guests to make up the difference .
If they don't get enough tips they won't be able to make a living .
And do they usually get enough tips .
Yes they do most of the time .
They generally make pretty good money .
That's good .
I'll go to the cashier's counter to settle the bill for you .
Please wait for your change .
Thank you .
If you're interested , I'd like to take you to a dance this evening .
I'd love to go , but I'm not very good at dancing . You know .
That's not a problem .
If I go would you promise to help me .
Sure .
I'll let you get acquainted with the place for a while . All right .
All right .
I've never seen a disco like this before .
Would you like to try this dance .
Why not .
How do you like this ballroom dance .
I like it very much .
We'd better stop idle talk and get down to business .
All right .
Let's Dance .
Mary may I have the favor to dance with you .
Sorry I'm engaged for this foxtrot .
May I have that pleasure for the next Waltz or tango .
Certainly .
May I invite you to dance .
Sorry I'm engaged for this tango .
May I have the pleasure of the next dance .
Sure .
Let's do the disco .
I don't care much for disco dancing .
And I'm too tired to move anymore .
All right , let's call it a day here .
Okay .
I didn't know you were such a good dancer Lin .
Thank you for your compliment .
I learned to dance when I was at university in China , but I haven't practiced for a long time .
I can see you're beginning to enjoy it .
Yeah , it's a good thing . I have come .
I've made quite a few friends here too .
I think we've had enough fun for the day .
Honestly , I've got to fight to keep my eyes open right now .
You were the center of attention . Tonight , you know .
Really .
All right , let's call it a day .
I hope you've enjoyed as much as I have .
Were you at the dance last night , Jane .
Yes , I was and I brought a friend from another school .
I didn't see you there .
I was there , but there were so many people and I didn't stay very long .
It was a nice dance , wasn't it .
Yes I enjoyed it very much .
I danced and danced until late into the Night . The band played very well , didn't they .
Yes .
The band as I know is mostly made up of students of our school but the conductor is a professional musician .
As the New Year's day is drawing near , we're planning a family dancing party .
Would you like to join us .
I'll be delighted to come .
Bring your friends to the party .
Yes , I will .
Are you free this weekend .
Yes , I am .
What's up .
Would you like to go dancing with me .
Absolutely .
There's a dance in the cafeteria this evening .
Would you like to go .
It's free . You know .
It depends on whether I'm asked .
Well consider yourself asked , would you go with me .
Okay . But I've got to be back before 11:00 PM .
Shall we go dancing for a change this time .
Well , I'm not in the mood for it . I've got 2 tests to prepare for next week .
You've got to take yourself a break once in a while .
Okay , I'll go with you .
I'm thinking of a new mask for tonight's costume dance .
That's a good idea .
Have you ever been to an occasion like this before .
No , this is the first time .
I can see it's going to be an exciting evening .
Yes , I think so .
Let's find a place and listen to the music first .
Shall I get you a drink or something .
Yes , please . I think I need it .
Here you are .
How do you like the music .
To tell you the truth . I'm not used to this kind of music . It's too fast .
Now the music is going on . Will you accept my arm .
With Pleasure I suppose you dance much .
Oh no . To tell the truth . I haven't danced for long .
Still you dance wonderfully .
LISTEN here goes your favorite music .
Shall we go for one more round .
Yes , I think I can manage one more .
You danced wonderfully tonight .
Thank you for your compliment .
You're indeed an expert dancer .
Thanks . I'm glad you say so .
I should think you dance much Mary .
To be honest , I have no brain for this kind of Thing I can't improve it at all .
Good heavens . There's no room for improvement .
You dance wonderfully .
Thanks . I'm glad you say s .
But I can tell you dance often too .
Sometimes , but I have no feel for it . I never seem to improve .
You're too modest .
Shall we call it a day . Wang .
Yes , I think so . People are beginning to leave .
Would you like something to drink before we leave .
All right . It's very kind of you to have accompanied me here tonight .
It's been a pleasure . And I must thank you for your patient coaching .
I've no idea about the Beijing Opera , could you tell me something about it .
Beijing opera is an integrated performing art on the Chinese stage .
It originated in the Qing Dynasty .
In the late 17 zeros . 2 bands of performers from Anhui and Hubei provinces merged and a new kind of opera came into Being That is Beijing opera .
You mean Beijing opera did not originate in Beijing did it .
No but it got its recognition and development in Beijing .
Oh I see .
Beijing Opera is a unique performing art that integrates singing dialog , acting And acrobatics the characters of Beijing opera are divided into 4 Groups they are Sheng Dan Jing and Chou .
What do they stand for .
Sheng is the male role Dan is the female role Jing is the martial role and Chou is the clown .
You can easily tell them by their costume and make up .
The colors and patterns on their painter faces have some symbolic meanings .
Like what .
For example when red is the main color of the face , it suggests loyalty blue suggests cruelty yellow suggests cunning and white suggests treachery .
It sounds interesting .
Another interesting thing about Beijing opera is that there were no female performers in the past and all the roles were played by men .
But now things have changed . We have both men and women performers .
What themes does Beijing Opera have .
They mainly come from historical events fictional tales folk stories and classical literature .
And many modern ones deal with the present reality .
Beijing opera seems to be a colorful and diverse art .
It is .
So you'd better squeeze an evening in to see a Beijing Opera .
I will .
Thank you .
I think we should go to the theater tonight .
What do you think Mr. Bus .
It's fine with me . But if the play is in Chinese , I'm afraid I won't be able to follow it .
No problem , I'll Be Your interpreter .
I am thinking we should go and see Beijing Opera .
Would you like to go .
Oh , I'd love to .
I have never seen such a performance , but you'll have to explain to me what's going on on the stage .
Okay . That's easy enough .
Miss Wang I hear that the traditional Beijing Opera is governed by certain conventions . I would certainly be grateful if you could tell me something about it .
Well , Beijing Opera originated in the late 17 zeros it developed from some local operas in Anhui and Hubei provinces .
Now it has become a unique performing art that integrates singing dialog , acting and acrobatic combat .
The actors and actresses are also different from one another . According to the characters they play .
There are 4 main groups of characters , namely the male lead . The female lead the painted face and the clown .
I'm still in the fog .
Let me explain .
The male lead plays the role of an ordinary MAN . The female lead , plays the role of an ordinary WOMAN the painted face stands for men with distinctly different looks and characters and the clown plays the role of a humorous or an evil man .
It sounds very interesting .
Moreover , Beijing opera can be roughly divided into the military plays and the singing plays .
Do the actors fight with guns in military plays .
In some modern military plays they fight with guns but in old plays they fight with spears and swords .
Havoc in heaven is a typical military play .
I know this is a story about the monkey king .
But can you give me an example of a singing play .
Interrogating Hong Niang is a singing play .
In a singing play singing and acting play an important part .
I know nothing about interrogating Hong Niang .
It is a moving love story .
The actress , who plays the part of Hong Niang has a beautiful voice .
Now , the opera is on at the People's Theatre .
Perhaps you will have no difficulties in understanding it .
Well , it's time to go .
Let's go .
How do you usually spend your weekends .
Going to a disco or to a karaoke bar because I like singing and dancing .
Do you know anything about Peking opera .
No , I Don't tell me something about it .
Okay .
Peking Opera is a combination of music , dance art and acrobatics .
Oh that sounds interesting .
How do they perform .
All the actions such as drinking , eating or rowing boats are shown by the movements of actors and actresses .
I think I should go and see it when I visit China next year .
How do you like the play .
I don't like it .
It is hard to understand , and it is boring .
I prefer straight plays .
On the whole the play isn't satisfactory at all .
You're absolutely right .
I think the acting could be better .
To be fair though both costumes and scenery are marvelous .
Well , I don't like the men's costumes . But the women's dresses are lovely .
Who's the actor who plays the Doctor .
That's William Bush .
I watched a drama in which he played the hero .
Last month the troupe was put on tour shows in Shanghai .
I thought he did well .
I didn't expect that he should have disappointed us today .
Well , we'd better go to a comedy next time .
I don't want to watch a tragedy until we have finished the journey .
I thought the musical comedy we saw last week before we started the trip was very good .
It was .
Yeah , they had constant changes of scenes and I love variety .
Me too .
I hate to sit there and look at the same stage scenery one act after another . I was tired of that .
Another reason might be that the lines are too difficult for us to understand .
Sometimes the body language is easier to understand for foreigners .
The charms of drama depend as much on the action as the words .
I quite agree with you there .
We have a popular saying in our country all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy .
We all believe that everybody needs recreation .
We cannot work all the time . If we want to maintain good health .
You're quite right .
I think everyone has his own way of relaxing .
Perhaps the most popular way is to participate in sports .
When I was young for recreation , I liked to play tennis in the summer .
My favorite winter sport was skiing .
You also have a favorite sport . Don't you .
Yes , my favorite sport is badminton .
Sometimes I also play table tennis or go swimming .
Many people enjoy sporting events , but they do not like to participate in them .
Chess card playing and dancing are forms of indoor recreation enjoyed by people old and young .
Are you a good dancer .
Not quite .
At my age I like to jog .
I think it is a very good exercis .
It's a pity . I haven't had much time for exercise lately .
I'm afraid I am putting on weight .
That serves as a timely warning .
You must try your best to reduce weight .
Would you like to go to the movies . Mr. Hunt .
What's on no .
Is there something good .
Look at the newspaper .
There is a western on at the People Cinema here it is .
The frontier .
Oh , I have seen it , are there any typical Chinese movie .
Yes , there are many .
Do you care for a kung fu movi .
What do you mean by kung fu Mr. Wang .
Kung Fu is a kind of traditional Chinese Martial Arts . It's different from boxing .
I see .
When I was a small boy I watched a Chinese television serial There were many kung fu shots in it .
Perhaps the name of that serial was Huo yuan Jian .
I can't remember .
It was wonderful .
I haven't seen such movies for years .
I often see a romance or science fiction . And today , I'd like to have a change .
Let's consult the newspaper for such a film here at the Globe movie City a very popular film by the name of Challenger is being on these days .
The box office of the movie is said to have broken the record of its kind in Hong Kong .
Who plays the hero , a Chinese or a Westerner .
Of course , a Chinese Zhou Runfa plays the leading role .
I've never heard of him .
But he is very popular with Chinese he's established his fame in Hollywood , too .
If you could only see some of his movies , you'd like him .
When shall we see the movie challenger .
Here is the timetable .
It's up to you .
Would you like to see the movie expectation .
It's the newest one , I suppose .
You bet .
The heroine is played by Nancy Keller .
Good .
She is my favorite star .
I must go and see it .
Will you go with me .
I will .
What did the Review say about it .
Not too bad .
The critics in the New York Times said it was rather light and colorful and entertaining .
Movie News gave it 3 stars .
But mind you , you can't always rely on the reviews .
We'll have a better idea after seeing it ourselves . Don't you think so .
Yes , I guess you're quite right .
I'll get the tickets reserved at the box office .
Why not call the box office to book the tickets .
It can save you a lot of trouble .
But I don't know their number .
I suppose we can find it in some local newspapers .
Let's look at the New Yorker here : It is 287 3,12 .
What time is convenient for you .
7:30 suits me fine .
Then you just wait for me here and I'll come and pick you up at 7 .
Thank you very much .
I'll be expecting you .
Goodbye .
Many people say Hollywood is a city of glamor , especially to those star struck teenagers .
I was born and brought up in Hollywood . I've seen Hollywood grow to what it is today .
Yes . It's the place I love best .
The constant sunshine and mild climate of southern California made most of my time happy and made Hollywood an ideal place for shooting pictures .
Have you been in the movie line .
Yes . Almost 40 YEARS , first as an actor , then a director .
And I am now a photographer touring around the world .
Do you think . Hollywood is so much a center of the world movies as before .
Movies were first made in Hollywood before World War I .
Its fame and fortune reached its peak in the 1930s and 1940s . The golden days of black and white movies .
Nowadays many cities are as well developed as the most prominent movie city .
I hear India produces almost as many movies as America but American movies are still the most influential in the world .
Yeah .
Things Are Changing maybe some day Xi'an or Sydney will take the place of Hollywood .
Nobody knows .
Hollywood is not only famous for its movies is it .
Producing movies is only an industry of Hollywood .
You know , about 80% of all American TV television entertainment comes from Hollywood .
I didn't know that .
It is also famous for its music .
Hollywood Bowl the huge outdoor amphitheater is very attractive .
Every summer symphonies Under the Stars are played by America's best orchestras before packed audiences .
My next stop is Hollywood .
I think I'll know more about movies there .
Have a nice trip .
Goodbye .
Shall we go to a movie tonight .
That's a good idea .
What's on .
Gone with the Wind .
What's it about .
Sorry . I've no idea .
I thought this movie should be a candidate for some film awards .
If I'm not mistaken . It has already won an Oscar .
Really .
I'm not surprised the camera work was very good and the scenery was beautiful .
I thought the acting was first rate too .
They're showing Titanic .
Can you tell me something about it .
It takes place on the sea and it's a wonderful movie . Don't miss it .
What's the name of the film tonight .
The Last Emperor .
I know absolutely nothing about it .
What's it about .
It's a story of a Chinese emperor .
Shall we go to a movie this evening .
I'd like to but , what will be on .
An action film .
Sorry , I prefer love stories .
Would you like to go to a movie with me tonight .
Yes .
Is it an American movie or a foreign movie .
American .
Then I'd like to go .
Have you seen ghost .
I saw it a few years ago .
What did you think of i .
It was outstanding .
How did you like the movie Rain Man .
I thought it was very good .
Which part did you like best .
I guess the scene that grabbed me most was when the 2 brothers were talking to each other .
I haven't seen such superb acting in a long time .
If I were one of the judges , I'd choose it for best film of the year .
The critics thought that it was one of the best films in the past 10 years .
I really enjoyed that movie .
This story was too sentimental .
To tell you the truth , I had tears in my eyes .
The part of the old man was well acted .
I just couldn't see the point of this movie .
The plot was simple .
It was just meant for entertainment .
But the music was splendid .
It had an all-star cast .
Yes , and the leading actor and actress are both my favorites .
At first I thought it was going to be a drag , but then it really got good .
Hello , Jack .

It was very exciting wasn't i .
Yes I was very proud of the Chinese players they won the championship .
So was I .

I am sorry about that . Alice , I don't know how to adjust it can you .
No I can't either . Why not take it to the repair shop .
I got it repaired 3 days ago .
Then I think your TV set is too old to repair .
Perhaps .
Oh how frightening please turn off the TV . John .
Why .
I don't want to watch such horrible movies they give me nightmares .
Mary . They are just stories .
What do you think about this week's TV series .
To tell you the truth , I don't think much of it .
What's your favorite TV program .
Actually I like variety shows better .
I also like a variety show but that depends on the host or hostess .
I agree .
If a host lacks humor . I would rather see none .
What's on channel 3 at 8 o'clock .
The TV series A Dream of the Red Chambers .
It's a satellite TV program .
What is it about .
It tells us a tragic love story of Jia Baoyu and Lin Daiyu in ancient China .
It sounds like a Chinese story of Romeo and Juliet , I should say .
The film Gone with the Wind , will be on Channel 20 tomorrow evening Vivian Leigh is a very famous actress .
Her performance is wonderful .
The actor , Clark Gable is excellent , too .
It's worth seeing .
Don't miss it .
All right .
I won't .
I am so excited to attend a typical Chinese concert .
So am I .
The first item is Chinese musical instrument ensemble , including such masterpieces as the Moon Night of Spring River and flowers .
The night of spring flowers River and Moon is one of the most wonderful pieces I've ever heard .
I'm glad you like it .
It praises the picturesque landscape of China .
What else .
The moon reflected in Twin Ponds that's an erhu solo butterfly lovers that's Violin Concerto and some other popular folk music and songs .
The concert of the Chinese folk music masterpieces must be impressive .
How many kinds of traditional Chinese music instruments are there .
I don't know exactly , but I'm sure there are at least 300 kinds , they can be grouped in 4 categories stringed instruments plucked instruments percussion instruments and wind instruments .
You must be proud of that .
Yes .
A Chinese wind instrument called Sheng was introduced to Persia , and later to Europe .
I hear there are over 50 nationalities in China .
I think they each have their unique music , don't they .
Yes . You are right .
Take the Dai nationality , for example , their taigu is terrific .
Oh the concert begins really wonderful .
What's that horse head-like instrument .
That's the horse head fiddle of the Mongolian nationality its music is rather moving .
Is there a solo of that fiddle .
I'm afraid there isn't .
What a pity .
Excuse me .
Can I help you .
I am a tourist from CHINA : My name is Zhang Feiyue . You play the violin quite well .
Thank you . Nice to meet you .
My name is Robert Johnson .
Call me , Robert .
I want to enrich my musical knowledge during the trip to Vienna .
Can you give me some suggestions .
You know , Vienna is a city of music .
You might hear Mozart Schubert Beethoven Strauss or Haydn at an opera house a church or an open air performance .
I am a fan of Mozart .
You've landed in the right city .
In this city steeped in musical traditions and institutions you'll only be able to hear his music in the concert halls , but also visit the places in which he lived and worked .
I hear Mozart Memorial is the place musical lovers frequent .
Yes , it's not very far from here .
You just walk along the street turn right at the Corner , then walk , 2 blocks and you'll be there .
Walk along the street and turn right at the Corner , then Mozart Memorial is only 2 blocks away .
That's right .
To a true Viennese a meal is not a meal without music .
Many restaurants provide customers with wonderful music as well as terrific cuisine .
Last night I did hear some first-rate musical performances at a restaurant called Wiener .
Wherever you go . You can enjoy the charms of music .
That's True Thank you for your suggestions .
Wish you Happy Music tour in Vienna goodbye .
The symphony orchestra , we're going to hear tonight is one of the best in Europe .
The playbill says that the first selection is Beethoven's Symphony number 6 in F Major commonly known as the Pastorale .
Are you familiar with this piece .
No . I'm afraid not .
There's a commentary about it in the Program . You can read it if you like .
Thank you .
Oh there's the conductor .
The concert will begin soon .
I can't stand modern music .
You mean Debussy Ravel and those composers .
No , I mean new rock jazz and the like .
Why don't you like it .
I don't know .
It makes me nervous just to listen to it .
How beautifully they played .
I enjoyed every minute of it .
Me too .
I had thought I wouldn't understand it , but when I heard the music I loved it immediately .
I reckon they played the Beethoven best .
I agree .
What kind of music . Do you like .
Things like Viennese Waltz folk songs and country music .
I enjoy country music , too . It's a kind of American folk music isn't it .
Sort of .
I think it was a very good performance .
How about you .
I enjoyed it very much too . I especially liked the piano concerto .
Yes , The Pianist was marvelous .
I wonder where he studied .
In Russia , I think .
He's been giving concerts for over 20 years .
Rock and roll , has a strong beat .
To tell you the truth , I'm not accustomed to this kind of music .
The acoustics are good in this hall .
Yes , I think so too .

How did you like the rest of the program at the concert last night .

The Quartet was not half bad either .
There was a special item on the Programme American popular music .
What do you say to that .
American popular music does not appeal to me .
But so far as I know it is played all over the world and is enjoyed by people of all ages in many countries .
I wonder why it enjoys such great popularit .
The reasons for its popularity are its fast pace and rhythmic beat .
I confess that Las Vegas is beyond my imagination .
The world is brilliant .
Do all the hotels have their own casinos .
Yes of course .
Then how many hotels are there in Las Vegas .
I don't know either .
I have never counted them .
Now , what kind of gamblings can we play here .
Anything you like .
Such as roulette blackjack craps baccarat Keno slot machine and so on .
Frankly speaking , I have never experienced gamblings before .
What may be the most popular type of gambling that a beginner can enjoy .
Slot machines seem too easy . Well how about roulette .
You have only to put out your tips or cash on the number , you'll be at first .
How can I get those tips .
The dealers can exchange your dollars for casino tips .

Good morning , Mr. Stone .
Good morning . Dr. Wang .
Sit down please what seems to be the trouble .
Well . Doctor : I've had a dull sort of pain in my back for 3 days and it got worse this morning when I was exercising .
Where exactly is the pain .
I can't quite pinpoint it .
When I sit or stand in a fixed position for a long time . I feel a dull pain across my back , but it doesn't seem to bother me when I'm lying down or in a relaxed position .
When did you first notice the pain .
About a week ago or so I'd been sitting for a long time talking with a business friend when I stood up afterwards I felt the pain .
Do you remember straining your back in any way . During the past 2 weeks .
Not that I can remember .
I played basketball . A couple of weeks ago , but I don't think it could be that .
Have you picked up or moved anything heavy .
No , I don't think so .
All right . Let me have a look .
Could you take off your coat and shirt and lie on the couch , please .
You don't think it's pneumonia , do you .
I'll give you a checkup .
I can't give you a definite answer until I see the results .
Do you have any fever .
How about your appetite .
No , I don't have any fever and my appetite's quite healthy .
Now breathe deeply and exhale slowly once more please . There is no respiratory murmur in your lungs , now does it hurt when I press here .
No .
How about here .
Yes . That hurts .
Was it a sharp or a dull pain .
Oh it was sharp not the usual type of pain I've felt recently .
All right . You can put on your shirt and coat now .
What seems to be the matter doctor .
Well , judging from the check up , it may be a slightly strained muscle .
Do you play basketball .
I used to play quite a lot but recently I've been too busy to play .
You said you played 2 weeks ago .
Yes , that was the first time in a long while .
I think that's where the trouble stems from .
Do you really think so .
Do you remember feeling stiff after that game .
Let me . See : Yes I did feel a bit of pain in my back the next morning .
But anyone has sore muscles when he exercises for the first time after a long break .
Yes , that's true .
But you might have hurt yourself during the game and not noticed at that time .
So what can I do about it .
I'll give you a prescription for some pills to relieve the pain and you should stay off work for 3 or 4 days and not lift any heavy objects .
You could try some massage .
It's usually quite effective at relieving pain like this .
There is a very good massage department in our hospital .
I heard there are a lot of top masseurs in China .
I'd love to try it .
Fine .
There's a well known masseur in this Hospital . I'll give him a call and ask him to take care of you .
Thank you very much . Doctor .
Goodbye .
Not at all . Goodbye .
What seems to be the trouble .
I feel sick all the time .
Any vomiting .
No .
Then I suggest you go to gynecology for further examination .
What's the trouble .
I've been losing sleep .
Is it troublesome .
It's getting more and more so .
I've been suffering from insomnia and I've got a ring in my ears , too .
Have you had much stress recently .
Yes .
You look rather pale .
I think I've caught a cold .
Take these pills and try to rest as much as possible .
Thank you .
Well , I'd better take your blood pressure .
It's 180/120 . I'm afraid it's a bit higher than the average .
Anything serious .
Oh no , but I think more vegetable and less meat is helpful for your health .
If your blood pressure goes up steadily . It will be dangerous .
Doctor what's this for , can you tell me .
This will relieve your pain and subdue this inflammation .
I see .
Thank you .
Remember this solution is for external use only .
What's the matter .
I have a headache and a sore throat .
How long have you had that problem .
For about 3 days .
Is there anything else that bothers you .
I perspired a little last night .
And I'm feeling dizzy now .
Well , I think you've caught a bad cold .
What's her problem .
She has been throwing up since yesterday evening .
She seems weak and she can't keep anything down . She has a stomach ache and a slight fever .
I see .
Let me feel her pulse and take her temperature .
Now I'd like to check her blood .
Is it serious .
No she should rest for about a week .
I'll prescribe some medicine .
Is it necessary to follow a special diet .
Yes .
She should eat some light food .
What's the matter with you , Mr. Sun .
I have a headache , a sore throat and a cough .
And I had a terrible stomachache early this morning .
Open your mouth wide please .
I just want to have a look at your Throat say .
.
It's red .
Let me examine your chest .
Just unbutton your clothes please now take deep breaths inhale exhale inhale exhale . That will do . Thank you .
I'll give you some pills and tablets and a cough mixture .
Here's the prescription .
Take the medicine every 4 hours .
I'm sure you'll feel better tomorrow .
Now let me take an X-ray photo of your stomach .
Follow me please .
Well Mr. Sun . What's wrong with you .
My ulcer has been worrying me lately and I want to know the result of the X-ray of my stomach .
Do you have a pain in your stomach .
Yes , particularly after meals .
I vomited blood yesterday .
Do you often do it .
No , I'd never done that before .
I see .
Let me see your X-ray result .
.
I thought so .
Mr. Sun . I'm afraid you need an operation for the ulcer .
Is it so serious .
I'm afraid so .
Operation .
What about my heart .
Let me feel your pulse .
Have you been weak lately .
Yes . I get tired rather easily .
Have you been losing any weight .
I suppose so .
The Mirror tells me that .
Has anyone in your family got heart trouble .
Well , both my parents have high blood pressure and my grandfather died of a heart attack .
.
Your heart is in a rather bad state .
I'm sorry to say you may need another operation some day .
You mean , I should have 2 operations .
Yes , very likely .
Otherwise you'll go on suffering from these complaints for the rest of your life .
Let me think it over Doctor Harrison .
When I've made up my mind I'll come again .
Good morning , Mr. Lawson .
Good morning . Miss temple .
I have bad toothache .
I want to see the dentist .
Have you made an appointment .
Sorry I haven't .
Is it very urgent .
Yes it IS : it is very urgent .
I feel miserable .
I feel an acute pain in one tooth that has a cavity and the one next to it . Aches in sympathy .
I couldn't sleep a wink last night .
But you haven't made an appointment .
Can you come the day after tomorrow that is May 25 . Monday at 10:00 AM .
No , I must see the dentist right now . Miss Temple .
I can't wait .
But the dentist is fully occupied now .
Well , well , let me go in and ask Dr. Green if he could spare you a few minutes .
Dr. Green said . If you could come again this afternoon at 3 o'clock .
That's too late .
Can't the dentist See Me Now .
I'm afraid that he can't Mr. Lawson .
Can't you wait till this afternoon .
I can wait , but my toothache can't .
What's the matter with you Henry .
You look unwell and your eyes are bloodshot .
I didn't sleep a wink last night .
I had such an awful stomachache that I was on the point of calling for urgent medical aid .
However , after I took some soothing pills the pain subsided .
How do you feel now .
I feel much better now . But a feeling of nausea still persists .
Is this the first time you've had stomach trouble .
In recent years . I have had occasional attacks of indigestion after eating something my stomach doesn't agree with , but I've never felt such a great pain in my stomach .
That is a rare case for me .
It might have been an attack of appendicitis this time .
I don't think so .
My elder brother was once operated on for appendicitis and he told me all the symptoms of this disease .
My case is something quite different .
I think you'd better consult a specialist .
Yes , I must go to see the doctor at once .
I hope there is nothing serious .
Do you feel short winded .
Yes . Sometimes I do .
Do you have pain in your chest .
Yes regularly .
I have a bad pain right here .
Go and have these tests first .
Here you are doctor .
I'm afraid you have an appendicitis this needs an operation .
Doctor my knees hurt but I wonder what you can do about it .
Rheumatism is often a chronic disease . I'll prescribe some Chinese herbal medicine for you .
Will you use acupuncture on me .
I will , if it's necessary .
I feel ill .
What's the trouble .
I've got a sore throat and it hurts to swallow .
I think you need a shot to relieve the pain first .
By the way I advise you to give up drinking and smoking .
Good morning . Doctor : I feel a pain in my chest and have a bad cough .
That's the Flu . I'll give you some cough medicine . And some antibiotics .
Thank you . Doctor .
Doctor : I feel like vomiting and I have no appetite at all .
How far pregnant are you .
About 6 weeks .
It's nothing unusual Take It Easy you'll feel better .
I feel very bad today .
Just put this thermometer under your tongue and I'll see if you've got a temperature .
You do have a Temperature I'll give you an injection , you'll feel better soon .
How do you feel .
I don't feel like eating anything I feel like vomiting .
How long has this been going on .
For 2 days .
I always feel dizzy and tired recently .
How's your sleep .
I can't sleep well because I've got a fever .
It sounds as if you've caught a cold .
What is the problem .
I ache all over .
How long have you been feeling like this .
Ever since yesterday .
I'm feeling rather out of sorts today my belly hurts .
Are your bowels regular .
No .
I've had 2 more movements this morning .
There's a bad virus going around there and maybe that's the cause .
Any pain here .
Yes it's sharp pain but just off and on .
Breathe deeply does it hurt when I press your chest .
Yes , and it hurts much when I cough .
Go and have your chest X-rayed .
You may have . TB .
I hear a roaring in my ears . And I feel giddy .
How long has this been going on .
A week .
Keep warm drink plenty of hot water and get plenty of rest .
Hello . Doctor : I've had a bad cough these days .
Please unfasten your jacket and shirt and let me . Listen to your heart and chest .
There's nothing to worry about your heart and chest sound normal .

Open your mouth and say .
.
I'll prescribe some medicine for YOU : it will relieve the pain in your throat .
Doctor this tooth often gives me pain .
It will have to be taken out .
Let me give you a needle to numb the tooth .
Is it very painful to have it taken out .
No .
I have a sharp stomachache doctor .
How about your appetite .
Not as good as before .
I can't eat much .
I'm afraid it's an acute gastritis .
I suggest you have your appendix removed .
What should I do to get better soon .
Don't overdo things and try to stay in bed for a few days .
Thank you . Doctor .
Doctor , could you tell me how to take the medicine .
Sure , as in your case , I'd like you to take one of these pills 3 times a day and 2 tablespoons of cough syrup should be taken every 2 hours .
Any other suggestions .
I hope you have a good rest .
Do you mean this drug will clear up my trouble doctor .
No , not exactly .
What do you mean then .
I mean it will relieve your pain .
What's the trouble .
I had to be out all afternoon yesterday on account of some urgent business although I had a cold .
When I came home after stopping for supper on the way . I had a headache and fever and a pain in the chest .
In fact I was in aches and pains all over , so I took some aspirin and went straight to bed during the night my stomach began to ache and I felt like vomiting I could get no sleep at all .
Oh , let me see .
Has the pain in the chest , anything to do with the upset stomach .
No , it has nothing to do with it .
Let me feel your pulse .
Open your mouth and let me see your tongue . Please .
Do you still have a stomach ache .
It's a little better than this morning , but it still aches .
Undress and lie down here .
Your throat is quite swollen . You have a touch of flu .
I'll give you a penicillin shot .
There's nothing seriously the matter with your stomach . So you don't need to worry about that . I'll give you a prescription take the liquid medicine 3 times a day . 30 minutes before meals and the capsules a half hour after meals .
Now then I must warn you against greasy food for a WHILE for 2 or 3 days . Eat only soft food such as soft-boiled eggs oatmeal milk and toast bread .
After that you may eat what you like but don't overeat for a while , even if you have an appetite .
All right . Doctor .
Thanks .

Can you help me , Miss . I want to buy a kind of mousse .
Great . Ma'am , which one do you like best .

Can you recommend anything .
Okay . Ma'am .
Here are many CHOICES , but among them the Ador and Mingxing styling mousses can be called the best .
They are home made and high quality products .
Ador mousse is a unique product which provides lasting style with a natural look and it is to provide flexible hold and control without stiffness or stickiness too .
Is it a light airy product .
Yes it is .
It is light so that you can use it . After every shampoo .
Well How about the Mingxing one .
Its function is the same as that of Ador .
But one distinctive difference between them is that Mingxing styling mousse contains Chinese herbs which can help mend your damaged hair .
Are you clear madam .
Yes , I'm as clear as crystal .
Thank you for your recommendation .
Maybe I think the mousse of Mingxing brand is suitable for me because my hair quality is not good enough .
It needs special care in some way .
You want to take it .
Yes . I take it .
But can you please tell me how to use it .
No sweat .
Before you use it you should shake it first . Then point it vertically downwards and squeeze a small amount of foam on your palm while spreading it evenly through the hair finally you can comb your hair and style it as you like .
Thank you .
I catch on it .
Okay .

It seems . I've never seen this kind Before Is it a gas water heater .
A gas water heater .
It's been on sale just for one week .
What features does it have . I wonder .
It is manufactured with technology apparatus and productions facilities imported from Japan .
It is high quality product with sophisticated design and fine finish .
But exactly in what way is it different from other types .
It has good combustion power its heating efficiency is 85% carbon monoxide POWER its heating efficiency is 85% carbon monoxide content is below% . Besides it is equipped with automatic flame extinguishing safety valves in case of fire the safety values will automatically shut off the gas passage within the shortest possible time to prevent gas leakage .
It sounds terrific .

How long is the warranty on it .
We have one year warranty .

What about the one displayed in the window .
It's the latest MODEL as far as I know it is only on sale here in Beijing .
Oh its look is superb . But I want to know in what way it differs from the ordinary videos .
It's called camcorder or the 3D CAM .
It uses 2 separate microcamera lenses to shoot 2 pictures at the same time on VHS C videocassette type .
Each of the 2 cameras serially records 60 pictures Per Second when the tape has been completed . The recorded 3 dimensional images can be reproduced on a TV screen using a standard VCR .
Images can also be replayed directly from the 3D CAM to the television .
Well , it sounds fantastic .
If you see feature films you must wear special glasses to see the 3-D images in this case liquid crystal these glasses are connected by an adapter to the VCR or the 3D CAM .
Can you show me how to handle it .
Okay .
Wonderful . It is .
But I figure it must be quite expensiv .
You have got it .
It's 11,200 yuan FEC almost twice or even 3 times as much as ordinary ones .

In that case . I'll Take It . I'd like to pay with credit card is that okay .
Certainly , sir , can you sign here .
Could you give me a receipt .

How long does it last on its batteries .
It'll last for 8 hours of consecutive Use then you'll have to recharge the batteries .
Is this for plugging into an electrical socket .
Yes .
We have a new line of toy telephones that have just arrived .
Would you like to get one for the children at home .
I do have to buy some toys for my nieces and nephews .
Yes . Can I see them .
Yes , we have a discount on these items 10% off the newly arrived toys and 15% off on the older ones .
Okay .
I'll take 2 of these and another 2 of those .
Can you suggest a toy for a 12-year-old girl .

Maybe some model ships with remote control .
Yes , sir .
What make do you want .

Good evening ma'am .
May I help you .
I'm trying to find hats for myself , but I haven't decided which one to take for . There are so many styles .
That's true .
May I recommend this one .
As for its design , it's acceptable but its color .
We have a dozen colors for this style black pink blue navy red , purple , orange gray yellow almost every possible color except green .
Why not green .
I prefer green to any other color , especially for my hat .
As you know ma'am different nations have different preferences and abhorrences .
Some Chinese tend to associate green hats or green scarves , with the loss of their spouses' love .
Thus few manufacturers supply green hats or scarves .
I see .
Maybe I have little hope to avail myself of a green hat in China .
Cheer up , ma'am .
It suddenly occurs to me that the Tristar store is selling green hats . But I don't know whether you can find a satisfactory style there .
Thank you so much .
By the way , where is Tristar .
2 people Road .
I know where the people road is .
Wish you good luck .
Goodbye .
Hello .
Can I be of service to you .
I'm just window shopping .
You are always welcome .
We sell all kinds of things used in ancient Chinese imperial palaces .
They look very interesting , especially the yellow gowns .
They are imperial gowns ancient Chinese emperors wear them .
Yellow is a noble color to the Chinese people .
The imperial laws forbade the ordinary people to wear yellow .
Did they .
But in my country purple is associated with being noble .
Cultures differ from country to country .
Why not try them on .
How much should I pay you for trying it on .
Free of charge .
That's fine . Is this yellow too bright for me .
It's very bright yellow , but it looks terrific on you .
Does it .
What size , is it .
It's size 8 .
But I wear size 10 .
Here is another gown .
It's Size 10 try it on you look so smart in the imperial gown .
Why not take one as a souvenir .
It's cheap only $100 .
That's a good idea . I'll take it .
Good morning , sir .
Can I help you .
I want to buy an electric shaver .
I like this one .
Here you are .
This model is quite popular This sample is the last one we have in stock .
How much is it .
$40 .
Can you lower your price a little .
I'm afraid we can't .
Our prices are non-negotiable .
But look .
The Shaver is scratched here .
Yes , that's the case .
Let me consult the director .
Sorry to have kept you waiting .
I'm glad to tell you that the director has agreed to allow you a 20% discount .
20% .
Still it's beyond what I can accept .
How about half the price .
Are you kidding . Sir .
I'm sorry , 20% is the farthest we can go .
This shaver works very well . It'll be worth every penny . You pay .
Moreover , the scratch is not conspicuous .
So 20% discount can more than compensate its defect .
Have you been helped sir .
I'm just looking right NoW Thank you may I see these ties .
Yes , certainly .
Here's a nice looking one .
Yes it is attractive , but I think it's a little too loud .
I am quite conservative .
Let me see that gray and blue one .
This one .
Yes , that's the one . How much does it cost .
600 yuan .
600 .
That's too expensive .
Well , sir . Taking into account the quality and workmanship you'll find the price is justified .
This is the rock bottom price .
It's well beyond the range . I can accept .
We can offer you a 20% discount if you are among the first 10 customers of the day .
So if you don't mind the trouble you can wait till tomorrow morning and come early , you may get it for say 480 yuan only .
That's an excellent idea .
I don't mind waiting .
By the way . Will this be cash or charge .
Both cash and charge are acceptable .
Yes . That'll be FINE goodbye .
Would you show me this brooch .
Yes I would .
What kind of stone is this .
It's Sapphire .

Will you try it on .

It's expensive for me .
My budget is $50 .
So I wonder if you have anything else within my budget .

This is just $50 and the same kind of stone as that one .
I like it very much .
But I'm afraid I don't like the design .
What about the other ones .
This is the last one that I recommend .

Is there anything else you want sir .
I can't make up my mind whether to buy this dark checkered suit or this maroon colored one .

Is there any difference between ready made dresses and dresses made to order .

We give them to our best hands to be made .
How much difference are we talking about .
Around 25% to 30% more perhaps .
Oh , that's a bit over my budget .
That's alright , Miss . There are perfectly beautiful dresses in our collection . You can try on .

I'm sorry to say we do not have any tea in this shop , but I can tell you the steeping method first put the tea leaves into the pot then put hot water into it . The amount of tea in proportion to water is 1 to 9 .
The temperature of the water is 100° Celsius , after 10 seconds the tea will be ready .
I see .
What is the price of this tea set .
It is 600 yuan .

Good afternoon , sir .
Can I help you .
I hear Chinese arts and crafts are famous for their excellent workmanship . I'd like to take some home .
We have various kinds of articles such as the tricolored glazed pottery of the Tang Dynasty embroidery Brocade Jade carvings wood carvings bamboo carvings lacquer ware braiding etc .
I want something typically Chinese and easy to carry .
Well , the tricolored pottery is beautiful but it's fragile Cloisonne is heavy and can be easily damaged .
I suggest you buy some embroidery It's easy to carry .
I'm interested in it , it looks delicate .
Here is a piece of SU embroidery .
Let me see it .
Oh a dog's playing with 2 balls .
The dog is so Cute How much is it .
500 yuan .
I'm afraid it's too expensive .
Too expensive .
Feel the Material look at the pattern .
Aren't they . Excellent .
Excellent as they are , they can't be worth that much .
This morning a peddler showed me a piece of SU embroidery . The pattern was GREAT he only asked for 300 yuan .
Did you take it .
Yeah . I took it for 250 yuan Only here it is .
They are quite different .
Yours is machine made . I mean it is mass Produced it isn't worth that much at most , it can sell 150 .
You were overcharged .
Really .
But look at all the embroidery I'm dealing with , they are all hand-made both sides display the exact same Pattern it's worth every penny . I asked for .
How about 400 yuan .
500 yuan is the lowest . I can accept .
I know some foreigners never bargain so I've never over priced my goods , you can compare mine with other sellers .
Then you'll find 500 yuan is quite reasonable for such an excellent item .
Okay . I do love it , I'll take i .
Here is the money .

Good morning , Pioneer computers Corporation Daniel Fok speaking .
Good morning , my name is Zhou I'm thinking of buying a personal computer and I'm just calling around to check out prices .
What type of computer are you looking for Mr. Zhou .
I'm considering a notebook , but I'll probably end up just getting a regular desktop computer .
What would you be using the computer for .
I'm starting up a small business in my home , and I need it to keep track of things .
Will you be traveling a lot .
No , I'll mostly be at home .
Then I probably wouldn't go for the notebook .
They're convenient , but if you're mostly going to be using it in one place , a regular computer is more durable and you get better value for your money .
Do you have any idea of what features you want .
What would you suggest .
Well , besides a word processor , you would probably want some spreadsheet software and maybe a painting program you would also want a fax modem and CD-ROM drive .
Will you be doing work that would require a scanner .
No , I don't think so .
If you would like to meet sometime we could further discuss what sorts of hardware and software . You might need and I could give you some prices on different options .
That sounds good .
I have an appointment tomorrow morning but could I meet you in the afternoon .
Yes . Around one o'clock .
One o'clock is fine . I'll see you then .
Hello . Is Mr. Thomas show here .
Yes I'm Thomas show can I help you .
I'm Mary of the local branch of Microsoft . I come here to discuss how you can make better use of computers in your business .
Would you mind if I come in and talk to you for a few moments .
Of course not . Come on in .
You own a home based catering business right Mr. Show .
Yes , that's right .
Do you have a computer now .
Yes , I got it several years ago .
It's a 586 processor .
What sorts of software . Do you use on it .
Well I use a spreadsheet program as well as a word processing program but I know they're both pretty old and outdated .
Have you considered upgrading your system .
Yes . But I'm not sure what exactly I would need .
Have you considered adding a painting program to your software .
It would allow you to make up your own flyers and banners for advertising , you can even make your own business cards with some programs .
That would be a definite bonus .
You might also want to upgrade your hardware because it is pretty outdated now .
You'd probably want more hardware and RAM a faster modem and a faster processor . Do you have a CD-ROM drive .
No .
You might want to add a CD-ROM drive because most new software programs are coming out on CD .
This sounds great , but how much would all this cost me .
Probably less than you think because you have all the basic components already .
If you like I can have a look at your computer and then check out some prices for you and make up an estimate .
Okay . That would be nice .
Come into my office , and I'll show you my computer .
They are state of the art computers .
Would you like to see how it works .
Yes , please .
Okay , let me just have it all set up in a minute .
They are great for business applications .
Look at how fast it runs .
I'm planning to set up a desktop publishing system and I need a computer with a hard disk and runs on a 32-bit .
Oh . In that case this model will do just fine .
Do you have the software for it already .
Yes , I have a Ventura .
Isn't it for IBM computers .
Yes they are .
You might also want to get the other paraphernalia that goes with it like the laser printer .
How is the resolution of your laser printer .
It's 300 dpi .
That's about the best you can get with this model .
There are others with a higher resolution but they'll cost more .
Are you doing this for business or as a hobby .
Well I'm starting it out as a hobby , to tell you frankly .
But later on I plan to expand it into a business .
Well this will definitely do .
You can expand the features later on , as you become familiar with the system . And when you start doing your business .
If I buy the computer now and buy a matrix.printer can I trade it for a laser printer later on and pay you the difference plus the cost of the depreciation .
Well , we don't do it here , but we can tell you where you can do that .
Anything can I do for you madam .
Yes , please .
I'm here to order a pillow for my new bedroom .
Very good mada .
What pattern . Do you have in mind .
We have a variety of pattern .
How about showing me some samples .
Right over here . Madam .
Please take your time to choose your favorite .
This one looks quite GOOD is it made of cotton .
Yes and the is made of satin .
Just what I've been looking for .
How much would a pillow like this cost .
Well , the cost of the material will come to $250 .
And what is your charge for the tailorin .
$100 . So the total is $350 .
All right , I'll give you the order .
Thank you . Mada .
Now tell me the sizes , please .
I've written everything on this piece of paper .
Good .
When will it be ready .
In about one week madam .
That'll be fine .
Here's a deposit of $100 I'll pay you the remainder when the pillow is ready .
Thank you very much . Madam .
If you'll wait one moment I'll make out your receipt .
Can I help you .

$550 .

Oh that can be done .
I wish to buy a diamond ring too .
How many carats , would you like it to be .
I want 3 carats .
Is this one suitable for you .
No , it seems too old-fashioned to me .
What about this .
Let me try it on .
Oh , it's too small for me . Haven't you got any larger ones .
Then you may take that one .
It's very nice and latest in style .
This fits me well , how much do you charge for i .
1,000 and $200 .
It's too expensive . I can only pay you $1,000 .
I told you before , ma'am . Our shop doesn't ask 2 prices .
Is that a real string of pearls .
Yes that's genuine .
Will you guarantee it .
You may take it on . My word . If you find out it is an imitation you may return it to me .

I've never seen a doll like this in Beijing .
My little girl will she .
How old is she .
She just turned 6 .
She'll start elementary school next spring .
Oh does school start in autumn in Beijing .
Yes , I heard it starts in September in the US . Right .
Boy , there is a lot to choose from here .
I can't even figure out what size to buy .
Well you look like you're about the same size as I am .
I usually wear medium .
Why are these boxer shorts , so expensive .
That's because they're made out of silk .
Silk .
I never expected to find vitamins in a supermarket .
Oh really . Why not .
In Beijing , we often have to go to a drugstore , and they're not expensive .
Then you should stock up on them . While you're here .
But there are so many kinds . And I don't know which one to buy .
Maybe I can help you .
Do you need vitamin C .
How did you find that last lot of marmalade .
Oh . Excellent .
But one or 2 buyers said the marmalade might be a little too sweet .
I see .
And the canned peaches what about them .
That's a different story .
The taste of The Peaches is FINE . But as you know appearance counts in canned foods .
Without any doubt appearance comes before price .
How could the canned peaches be improved .
I recommend a pleasant color and no mess .
Where's the mess . Exactly .
In the syrup or in the peach halves .
Customers have told me that hollow of the peach halves . You know the inside of the peach should be clean cut that is to say no fibers or pulp remaining .
Aren't they supplied that way now .
No many consignments are not .
Mr. Johnson . We've been having a little trouble with your surfacing and polishing machine .
I KNOW your import Division wrote to us about defective work .
Have you looked into the 3 cases , they reported .
We have , and they seem to be 3 cases of mishandling .
Mishandling .
Do you mean careless handling by the machine operators .
That's what it looks like .
Have you had similar complaints from other users .
No , none at all .
Have you replied to . The report our head office sent you .
No , we've asked our representative to call and explain and if necessary to go along to see the machines .
That will help . Thank you .
Perhaps their own maintenance engineers have spotted the trouble and fixed it .
I hope so .
Are these goods needed urgently .
Not urgently .
We want to be able to release them in our market , say , 3 months from now .
Then I'll have a talk with one or 2 of our makers .
They'll be in to see me sometime this week .
What else have you got outstanding besides these piece goods .
The made up goods for Europe and the rayon scarves for Southeast Asia .
Well , the last lot of scarves after we took the delivery . We heard of a competitor . Getting similar scarves from the same maker only at $30 per dozen .
Reall .
We'll look into THAT might have been a question of quantity again .
Anyway . We'll see what the makers have to say about this .
Well , that's about all for the present .
We may have some more business for you before Long . Let's hear from you about market conditions from time to time .
Certainly , I'll let you know what's going on .
Good morning , sir .
Can I help you .
I hope so , I'd like to make a complaint .
I bought a rather expensive cardigan from you last week .
Is there anything wrong with it .
Oh my goodness .
The cardigan was not only completely ruined but also ruined a large number of expensive clothe .
Oh dear .
That doesn't sound too good .
No , it certainly doesn't .
The day before yesterday , I was walking in the cardigan and it started to rain .
The color ran .
I could see the dye dripping from IT : the dripping dye ruined my trousers shirts and vest .
Oh how awful .
I hang it to get it dry and the following morning , it was about half the original siz .
For cardigans of this kind . You have to stretch them carefully before drying them .
I did try to stretch it carefully and also I saw what happened all the buttons were off .
But did you use excessive force sir .
I certainly Didn't Why are you so bossy .
Perhaps you could show me the cardigan in question , sir .
Yes of course .
Here it is .
I'm afraid , sir , I don't think you could have brought it here .
.
You see the label is .
That label .
The original label had come off .
I mean , obviously you've been trying to cheat me by putting on your fancy label on a cheap mass produced article .
I can assure you , Sir . That we have the highest reputation for both quality and honesty .
What do you mean .
I've never been insulted like this in all my LIFE I shall draw my custom .
Good morning , sir .
I'd like to speak to the manager .
I am the manager madam .
How can I help you .
It's this radio . It doesn't work .
Did you buy it here .
Of course .
Look you switch it on and nothing happens .
Could I see your receipt .
Receipt .
I haven't got one .
Oh , you should have obtained a receipt when you bought it .
I probably DID I might have thrown it away .
Well , have you got any other proof of purchase the guarantee for example .
No .
It must have been in the box , I threw that away too .
Oh dear .
You really ought to have kept it .
And did you check the radio before you left the shop .
No , it was in the box .
I expected it to WORK it wasn't a cheap radio It's a good make .
You should have checked it .
Please stop telling me what I should have done and do something either give my money back or give me another radio .
There's no need to get aggressive madam .
Let me look at it .
You see this little switch on the back .
Yes .
It's on mains and it should be on battery .
You really should have read the instructions .
Is there anything I can do for you .
Yes , I'm looking for the shoe counter .
It's on the second floor .
Oh , thank you .
Can I have a tax refund form please .
I'm from China .
Sure .
By the way , where can we get back the duty paid .
At customs of any European Union countries .
Excuse me . Could you help me .
Lost Property clerk . Yes .
Lost Property clerk what seems to be the problem .
Well , I was wondering if anyone has turned in a passport .
I'm afraid not .
Have you lost your passport .
I think so .
I can't find it anywhere in my hotel room and I remember the last place I used it yesterday was in this department store .
Where exactly did you use your passport in the store .
In the shoe department .
I had to show it to pay for these shoes with my traveler's checks .
Well , let me call the shoe department to see if they've found a passport .
Sorry your passport's not been turned in there either .
Then what shall I do .
You can fill in this lost property report and I'll keep my eye out for it .
Those kinds of things usually turn up eventually but I suggest you contact your embassy and tell them about your situation so they can issue you a new passport in case it doesn't show up .
You're right .
Do you have a pen .
Here you are .
Oh I seem to lose something every time I travel .
Excuse me , I bought this just now , and here's a receipt .
I'm afraid I was short change .
Could you look into it .
Oh really .
Just a moment you paid with a $10 bill and I gave you , oh , sorry . Here's a 5 left .
I'm terribly sorry .
I put in 2 fives for a Coke but nothing came out of the machine .
Really .
Let me check the machine .
I'm sure it's broken .
No , sir . I'm afraid you put in 1-5 and a $1 coin .
What should we do when our shipment has been totally lost or partially damaged .
We must prepare our claim and send it to the insurance company to secure payment .
Do brokers , take that .
Yes , they usually do .
In Europe they charge a 1% commission on the amount of the claim for their collecting services while in the United States . They do the work without charge to the importer .
That's part of the service on the broker's side .
Exactly .
When we have bought insurance for the country of destination we can directly contact the insurance company or through our brokers .
What are the documents needed to obtain paymen .
Well , let's talk about that next time .
How much are these altogether .
$1,00 .
It's too expensive .
Can you give me a discount .
Your discount is already included .
Normally we charge 1,000 and $500 but we're giving you a special price .
This is our sale period .
I see . Can I pay by check .
I'm afraid you can't .
We accept only traveler's checks and credit cards .
Anything else , sir .
That's all for now .
How much do I owe you .
That'll be $55.30 .
Can't you make it a little cheaper .
Just a moment .
I'll talk to the manager .
Sir , we can give a 15% discount .
Oh good .
Thank you .
What can I show you .
I'd like to see some handbags .
Here you are .
How much is this .
I must say you have good taste .
This one costs only $100 .
Oh , it's too expensive .
Please give me a discount .
I'm sorry .
I can't reduce the price .
Are all these goods on sal .
Yes we are clearing our stock right now .
Anything you are interested in .
Yes . Show me that wallet , please .
Yes , sir . Here you are .
How much do you ask for it no .
We are offering it at half price , 45 yuan .
Can't you make it may cheape .
I'm sorry , but we've already cut down the price below its cost level .
It's really inexpensive for its quality .
Are you sur .
Yes , of course , sir .
How much are these tennis rackets .
These are $200 and these are $180 .
$200 is too expensive and $180 is still too expensive .
May I see some cheaper ones .
Sorry , this is all we hav .
I see . I like this $180 racket very much .
Could you give me a 25% discoun .
Sorry , our prices are fixed .
How much do I owe you .
That will be $80 .
Can you come down a little .
I'm sorry , sir .
That's the best we can do .
Please have them wrapped up for me .
Is there anything else you might need .
That will be all for the moment .
Thank you . Please come again .
I bought this pair of trousers last Friday as soon as I washed it I found it shrank .
Do you have the receipt .
Yes , I don't want it any more .
But I'm afraid I can't give you a refund .
Why .
I hope you're not Joking I spent so much on something I couldn't wear .
I got annoyed .
Try a little calmer .
As a rule , customers are supposed to check all goods thoroughly before purchase as the shop cannot give refunds .
But how do I know that .
You didn't tell me about it when I was buying did you .
Did you read the sign there .
What .
Oh .
Would you please exchange something else of the same price you can exchange for another size .
Will that shrink too .
If you get a larger size it will fit you even after it has shrunk .
What size is yours .
It was 26 inches around the waist .
Here is the one of 29 , will that do .
I suppose So I don't seem to have any other choice but to exchange it .
Excuse me , but please change this .
Why .
There is a crack .
Can I have it replaced .
Let me see .
And here is a stain .
I'll change a new one for you .
Can I get a refund for this .
Of course .
Can I help you , sir .
Yes you can . I bought this China vase at this store yesterday , but when I opened the box back at my hotel , I found this crack in the bottom .
Let me have a look at it .
Well we will gladly give you another sir .
Please accept my sincere apologies .
That's fine .
Can I have my money back on this skirt .
Anything wrong with it .
Yes , this is defective See .
I didn't notice this hole when I bought it .
Oh I'm very sorry about that .
You can change it for another one . If you prefer .
If you have exactly the same one same color same design and same size of course .
This one is the same size and color .
But the design is different .
Oh , I guess I have no choice . I'll take this one .
I bought a pair of shoes in your bargain sale yesterday and they felt okay in the shop , but they seem a little tight now Would it be all right if I returned them .
I am sorry , sir . But we can't take back goods bought in the bargain sale .
Then can you replace them with a larger size .

Here is my passport when you do the registration you can copy my name and all the other things you want to know from the passport .
It would save time .
I can see you are a very smart young lady .
But , pardon me , madam , do you mind filling the blanks in the register book yourself .
I'll check with your passport afterwards .
Don't you think that would be even quicker .
Yes , perhaps , that would be a quicker way .
It shows you are smarter than me . Anyhow .
Thank you for your compliment madam .
Not at all .
There's yet another way supposing you do the registering with the help of my passport since you know what items should be entered in that big book and let me do the checking afterwards since I know more about myself than you do .
Surely that's the quickest and the best way .
Okay .
You've won .
There's no need now .
I did the checking when you were copying from my passport .
Now you see why I told you it would be the quickest way .
Now I see why I'm told the Chinese are most clever .
Well , here's your passport and the key .
Your room number is 918 .
You'd better go up by the lift at that end of the Corridor it's nearer to your room .

Where is it .

But the Americans call it the first floor .

Anyway the dining hall is on this floor .
If you go to the other end of this lounge and turn to the right , you'll find i .
The door faces the souvenir store you won't miss it .
Thank you .

How do I use these washing machines .
It's very simple .
The regular loads cost a dollar 50 and each machine takes quarters .
Oh , I should have brought some quarters . I didn't think of that .
That's no problem .
We have a change machine right over there . You can get change for a 1-5 or even $10 bills .
Just insert the bill face up and the machine will take it and it'll give you your quarters in change .
Just like Las Vegas .
Any chance I'd get more quarters out than I put in bills for .
I wouldn't count on it .
The washing machines are easy to use .
First you select your temperature add your laundry then place your quarters in the slots put it in right there and that starts the machine .
That seems easy enough .
But what about the soap .
Watch the lights on the machine .
When the detergent light goes on add detergent .
When the bleach light goes on add bleach .
And just wait until the machine is finished .
Where can I get detergent and bleach .
We have a vending machine right over there that takes quarters .
You can get a box of detergent and a box of bleach for only 50 cents .
I really appreciate your help .
My pleasure .

The housekeeper should check every room before new guests move i .
One doesn't expect this sort of thing in a well run hotel .
No madam .

It's unusual we do try to check the rooms as thoroughly as possible .
Just one pillow was it .
Is there anything else .

That's fine .
Thank you .
By the way , where is your laundry .
Here in the laundry bag .
Any more .
Yes .
Well , I want to have a suit dry cleaned .
I have an important dinner to attend at 6 o'clock this Evening Do you think I could have it back before then .
Let me see .
It is 2 now . And there are still 4 hours to go .
I think you can get it back in time .
Our special laundry service can do it in less than 3 hours .
How much do you charge for the special laundry .
In addition to the normal charge , there is a 50% extra charge .
That sounds reasonable . As long as you can get my suit cleaned and sent back to me in time .
No problem .
Laundry Service .
Can I help you .
Yes .
I want to have a dress washed but I'm afraid it might fade .
There shouldn't be any problem , ma'am . But you will need to write down special instructions on your laundry list .
I also have an evening dress that is torn .
You might ask the housekeeping clerk to mend it for you .
Or if you have us wash it you can write in the laundry list the evening dress needs both washing and mending .
That's a good idea .
I have 2 blouses , one needs to be washed . And the other needs to be dry cleaned .
Does the tag on the one for dry cleaning say dry clean only .
I don't think so .
It shouldn't matter .
We'll be very careful .
Just put the one for dry cleaning on your dry cleaning list and then put it together with the dry cleaning list in the dry cleaning bag not the usual laundry bag .
Thank you for giving me so much information .
Is there anything else I can help you with .
I think that's all for now .
Thank you .
I'd like to know your laundry service hours .
If your laundry is received before 11:00 AM . We'll deliver it to your room by 9:00 PM the same day .
For more information , please dial 8 and you'll get housekeeping .
Thank you .
I'd like to have this laundry done .
Could you fill out the laundry form .
Okay .
By the way , I want to have this sweater washed by hand in cold water it might shrink otherwise .
By hand in cold water . I understand .
Excuse me . Have you any dirty laundry .
I have some .
Please leave it in the laundry bag .
The laundry woman comes over to collect every morning .
Thank you .
Please tell me whether you need your clothes ironed washed or dry cleaned and also what time you want to get them bac .
I want it dry cleaned and ironed .
If you can make it . I'd like it back this evening .
No problem .
Goodbye .

Why not .
He's trying to persuade us of his innocence .
He is .
Robbie's father bought him a car for his birthday .
Are you kidding .
His dad said he wouldn't give him a single penny after Robbie dropped out of business school .
But Robbie managed to persuade him somehow .
I can't believe it .

Goodbye . Have a nice day .
Have you been to Beijing before .
Yes . 3 times , all on business .
Today , I'm here for sightseeing will you recommend me some places of historic interest and scenic beauty .
Yes , I'd like to .
Among the most famous are the Tian'anmen Square the Palace Museum the Summer Palace the Temple of Heaven . The Fragrant Hills and the Great Wall .
Please locate the Tian'anmen Square for me on the map .
It's here .
Tian'anmen square is one of the largest square in the WORLD . Many great historical events happened there .
Where's the Palace Museum .
It's on the north of Tian'anmen .
Until 1911 . The palace was off limits to ordinary citizens so it is also known as the Forbidden City .
It was constructed in a 14 year period during the 15th century .
24 emperors lived and ruled there for almost 500 years .
You mean it can tell me 500 years of Chinese history .
You're quite right .
Another place well worth visiting is the Summer Palace .
It is a grand park of historical importance .
You can also learn something about the Chinese history there .
I'll include it in my sightseeing list .
Just now you mentioned a temple What is it .
Oh , it's the Temple of Heaven .
It has the largest group of temple buildings in CHINA this building complex is noted for its exquisite layout harmonious color and unique structure .
My wife specializes in architecture .
I want to be more knowledgable about this Field . The trip to the Temple of Heaven might be a good education .
I hope so .
What about the Fragrant Hills .
The Fragrant Hills is a park located several miles west of here it's famous for its red leaves in autumn .
It's a good place for sightseeing isn't it .
Yes .
And the Great Wall is a place appealing to both Chinese and foreigners .
I've been there .
I went there on my first business trip . Although I was very busy .
It is said that the Great Wall is one of few man made wonders people can see with the naked eye from the moon .
It's a wonder of the world's architectural history Why not go there again to enrich your knowledge in architecture .
Good idea .
I'll visit it again .
What a huge museum of the terra cotta army .
It was built in 1979 , 230 meters long , 72 meters wide and 22 meters high it houses over 6 terra cotta warriors and horses .
It's a mighty army What's that .
That's the reviewing stand .
Marching in the front are 3 ranks of vanguards each rank has 70 warriors .
And behind them is the main body of the army .
That's right .
The Warriors and chariots are placed at regular intervals .
There are 38 files each 180 meters long .
The Warriors on both sides of the Army body are quite different . They all face outside Why is it so .
Most of the terra cotta warriors here face the east because the state of Qin was located in the west .
The First Emperor fought eastward to unify China .
The soldiers on both sides of the main army body are flanks their task was to guard against enemy attacks and outflanking so they face outside and there is another array of warriors at the rear .
They also face outside .
What a mighty battlefield .
Were they arranged in another array of warriors at the rear .
Yes they were .
The terra cotta warriors were in the same manner looked when excavated .
They were vividly molded .
Look their facial expressions vary .
Yes . Some are proud some ferocious and some even close to a smile .
It's amazing that the sculpture had attained such a high artistic level at that time .
It is really a wonder of the world .
Who is it .
Excuse me , I'm sorry to bother you .
I'm a neighbor of yours and I have no phone my child is ill and I need to call a doctor .
Can I just come in and make a phone call please .

You fool .
Give him the few lousy bucks . Your life is more precious .
You're really lucky the mugger just hit you instead of stabbing you .
I suppose you're right , but I got angry .
A few dollars aren't that important .
If you lose money you can always get more if you lose your life , it'll be all over .
You know why you were mugged .
You made a big mistake .

I don't think it will , it hasn't rained for a week , and it isn't cloudy either .
But the forecast is usually correct .
The temperature is 24° today .
I'm sure we'll have fine weather tomorrow .
Well , I hope we WILL but I'll take an umbrella .
Good morning . Happy hobby shop .
May I help you .
Yes you sell models don't you .
Oh yes .
They're our most popular items we carry all of the major brand names , and many of the less well-known brands .
Well I'm not as interested in the makers themselves as in the models .
Some friends and I are interested in refighting some of the tank battles of 1940 .
We have some very realistic war games already developed for trying different tactics and strategies for all the major battles in world history .
Those usually use bits of cardboard for pieces , don't they .
Yes , sir .
We'd like to have the actual models .
Very good , sir .
If you'll tell me what you want . I'll have the stock gather it together before you come in .
That's a good idea . We need tanks for the French army . We need 1435 randss and 12 FCM36s for the British 19 M4Cs for the German 17 Pz38s .
Okay . I've got that .
Anything else .
Yes , we're short on both mortars and antiaircraft guns for the Dutch army and automatic rifles . For the Belgian army .
Fine . I'll see what we have .

What's the weather forecast today .
The newspaper says fine with occasional showers .
Hadn't we better put off our picnic for another day .
No . Let's take a chance and go .
But it looks like rain just now .
Black clouds are gathering .
Yesterday morning the sky was also covered with clouds . But it turned out to be fin .
I think a shower won't last long .
It'll soon clear up .
Don't worry .
Well if you insist . Let's have our picnic today .
That's great .
Let's get things ready .
I'm afraid you got caught in the rain this morning .
Did you get wet all through .
No .
The shower came on all of a sudden but I escaped the worst of it .
It didn't look like rain at all . This morning , did it .
But you never can tell .
I usually carry an umbrella all the time in this season .
But I forgot all about it this morning .
You must be careful in this weather .
Yes , it's awfully wet .
See the sky is heavy . It's going to come down again .
I'm so glad you needn't go out this afternoon .
So am I .
We've been having so much rain these days it seems to be clearing up though .
Really .
I don't think so .
What does the weatherman say about tomorrow .
Warm and sunny but I don't believe it .
What is the weather forecast for today .
The weatherman says it will be mostly sunny and fairly warm .
The temperature will average between 21° and 26° .
We're having a picnic tomorrow . Why don't you come with us .
I'd like to but I Think : It's Going to Rain , the weatherman says it is .
I don't think he's RIGHT it hasn't rained for a week , and it isn't cloudy today either .
But he's usually correct in his weather news .
The temperature is 80 degrees . This afternoon I'm sure we'll have fine weather for our picnic .
Well , I'll go , but I'll take my umbrella with me .
I'm wondering if it's going to be fine . This afternoon .
So what .
I'm going to visit my aunt in Georgia .
Don't you see the wind's beginning to lift it up .
I bet it will be fine tomorrow .
But do you know the weather forecast .
Yes .
It says it's foggy and sometimes it will be overcast with drizzle today .
But it'll be clear and fine tomorrow .
That's good news .
A Beautiful Day , isn't it .
Yes . Nice and sunny for a change .
It's so great to see sunshine again after those rainy days .
I prefer sunny days to rainy days .
Could You Sleep Last Night .
No . The storm was so terrible .
I was in a taxi when the storm was starting .
Some trees were blown down many streets were flooded by the heavy rainstorm and the traffic was delayed for almost 2 hours .
When did you get home .
At 11:00 PM .
But the worst was that My house was full of water too .
How terrible but I still think we are luckier than those who lost their homes .
I hear 3 people died in the rainstorm .
What bad news .
I wonder what the weather will be like tomorrow .
I haven't heard the weather report on the radio but I expect it will be warm too .
I think so . It seems days are getting longer and longer .
Yes , summer is around the corner .
Many people , especially the young people are looking forward to its coming .
Right . It is a season of sports .
The weather in England is always changing , isn't it .
Yes . People can experience 4 seasons within a single day .
It is too changeable for people to be sure what the weather will be .
Yes it is true .
And maybe that is why Englishmen say that other countries have a climate but in England they have weather .
By the way , what's the weather like in Guangzhou .
Well , spring is rainy and summer is humid and a bit hotter than here .
What about autumn and winter .
Autumn is dry and winter is a bit cold but the temperature never drops to the freezing point .
It sounds good .
What is the weather like today .
It has stopped snowing , but there's a bitter cold wind .
Look at the icicles there hanging from the eaves .
And the streets are covered with ice .
Do you happen to know what the temperature is today .
I missed . Today's weather forecast over the radio .
It feels like 15 degrees below zero at least .
I don't mind the cold weather , but I do hate it when it gets slippery .
The ice will soon be thick enough for skating .
I'm so fond of winter sports .
That's fine .
Let's go skating together tomorrow .
Did you hear the weather forecast this morning , Henry .
No , I didn't .
But I can tell you without any forecast that the weather is nasty .
Look how overcast the Sky is and there's the feel of rain in the air .
Yes Autumn is here with the drizzle and slush .
Rain or shine . I must go out .
I have some shopping to do .
They say , we'll have a mild winter .
It was horribly cold last winter .
But the sunny Mornings with the icicles hanging from the roofs , weren't they . A real pleasure .
Yes they were , but I had no time to go for walks in the morning .
Besides the streets were often terribly slippery and it made walking rather unpleasant .
Horrible weather we're having .
Yes indeed .
It's been raining for 3 days .
Do you have any idea what time it is now .
Oh , I'm sorry I don't wear a watch .
Beautiful weather isn't it .
Sure is .
It's quite clear .
I think it will continue to be fine .
I hope so .
You're from Los Angeles , aren't you .
Yes , I am .
Is the climate there similar to what we have here .
Not quite .
Usually we don't have so many windy and dusty days . Also , the summer is never as hot as this is .
We'll have a heat wave I feel .
It's really very close and sultry TODAY not a leaf is stirring .
You're right , it's muggy and oppressive , there's hardly a breath of air .
I feel a thunderstorm is Brewing do you see the sheet lightning there .
Yes I do .
The sky is overcast and the sun is going in it looks like rain .
What a gust of wind .
It's beginning to rain .
The rain is torrential it's absolutely pouring down now .
It's raining cats and dogs .
It's clearing up the clouds are lifting .
Yes , it has left off raining .
Look at this wonderful rainbow .
Would you like a package tour or traveling alone .
I prefer a package tour . So we don't have to worry about accommodation , meals , or that sort of thing .
I prefer traveling alone , and having a lot of time to linger in one place .
What are you planning for next weekend .
I haven't given it thought yet .
Have you got anything special in mind .
Let's go to Valley Park on Sunday , shall we .
That's a good idea .
Would you be interested in sightseeing .
Yes .
Where do you suggest we go .
How about Broadway .
That's wonderful .
Would you like to visit Wall Street with us tomorrow , Mary .
I'd love to .
I've heard so much about it .
We'll visit the stock exchange there .
That's good .
Thanks for inviting me .
I'm going on a guided tour around the mountain city .
Are you coming with me .
Thank you . But I have to see my parents tomorrow .
Have fun .
Thank you .
Shall we go alone or as part of a group .
Well we're arranging to go on a package tour .
Would you like to join us .
Okay .
What interesting places are there to see .
Many such as Central Park , the Statue of Liberty and Lincoln Center .
I'm sure you will enjoy it .
Do you have a map of New York .
Yes I do .
I can give you this one .
I suggest you stop at the Visitor's Bureau near the train station .
They can give you more information .
Thank you .
What can I see in my 2 days here .
We can take you to most of the places of interest in a couple of days .
That's great .
I bet you had your picnic on the island .
Yes .
It was marvelous .
The water was warm when we swam .
What a day we had .
I wish I had joined you .
Well , did the others enjoy it too .
You bet .
We'll never forget it .
You seem to know your way around Guangzhou .
I've been here several times on business .
May I ask your advice on what places to see .
I'd be very happy if you would show me around the Pearl River Delta this time .
It'll be a pleasure .
Hi , Tom .
When did you get back from Shenzhen .
Just yesterday .
How was your trip .
I loved it .
I visited splendid China and China's folk culture villages and I had a great time .
Well , tell me what's your impression of Shenzhen .
It's smaller and much less crowded than Guangzhou .
Its market tours were not as fascinating as Guangzhou's I think .
Where do you intend to spend your summer vacation this year . Jane .
I'll spend my vacation in the mountains . As usual .
I've been going to the mountains every summer with a group of tourists .
Last summer we found a site where was a crystal clear stream nearby .
Why did you choose a site with a stream nearby .
I like swimming , you know .
In the afternoon . I'd like to plunge into the stream to cool off .
Where do you like to go for your summer vacation this year .
I'll go to the seaside as I did last year .
As for me , vacation is no vacation without the sea .
Why so .
It seems to me , I can never tire of the sea .
It is beautiful , in all kinds of weather and at all times of the day .
Did you go bathing in the sea . While you were there .
Yes of course .
We'd go bathing even in the evening with the silver beams of the moon reflected on the water .
That sounds very interesting .
Well , I've changed my mind .
I'll go to the seaside this year for a change .
Xiao Yang I've visited LA twice and can be your tour guide for this area .
So what do you want to see .
Disneyland is a must .
I'm also dying to see Hollywood the movie city .
Yes there are the Universal Studios .
I also want to see the Ocean Park , Santa Monica beach and .
I'm afraid we have time only for Disneyland and the Universal Studios as we only have one and half days .
We'll go to Mr. Bowen's home for a barbecue party on Sunday afternoon . Do you still remember .
Oh yes .
But can we first see a movie tonight .
Of course we can .
I like action movies .
Car chases gun fights .
I like them too .
But let's have dinner first .
What do you suggest we eat .
Let's have a typical American dinner .
There is no such a thing as a typical American dinner .
There are only French food Chinese food Italian food Mexican food or mixtures .
Well then what would be a typical dinner for Americans .
I think it's perhaps steak baked potato and green salad .
All right , I'll try that .
Toronto is really a lovely place to visit .
Since August .
I have experienced , the International Film Festival here in September and the International Festival of Authors in October .
They were both very exciting .
Are you an author .
No , I'm a businessman , but I'm interested in literature and so are my children .
They are interested in fairy tales .
Speaking of children , have you taken them to the children's own museum .
That's a paradise for children , especially those between 1 to 8 years old .
My children are both of the right ag .
The elder one is a boy aged 7 and the younger one is a girl aged 3 .
It's a learn while you play center .
Children can learn a lot while they play there .
The museum includes a sensory tunnel a construction site . A garden , an animal clinic and a theater .
Sounds terrific .
Are parents required to accompany them .
You can accompany them if you like .
You can also let staff members take care of them .
But both my children are quite naughty although lovely .
Don't worry about that .
The members are well trained .
They are wonderful with kids .
Furthermore naughty kids are mostly energetic and intelligent .
They can direct children in the right path .
My husband and I are all busy all day . So we've got little time to play with the children .
The museum suits us , fin .
Another attraction for children is the Riverdale Far .
They can watch the cows and pigs and pet hundreds of other animals .
My 3-year-old daughter always asks us to feed a puppy for her .
Children love animals .
They'll have a good time there .
Thank you for your suggestions .
Have you ever heard of American Greyhound buses .
Yes I have .
You can go to every corner of the United States by Greyhound bus can't you .
You're right .
Last summer I traveled from New York to San Francisco by Greyhound .
Why did you take the bus instead of the train .
Well , I can see the country better that way .
You mean you can see the country better because the bus is slower .
No , not that .
The bus takes a better route as far as scenery is concerned .
Incidentally the Greyhound bus is very fast .
In the open country it often travels at 65 miles an hour .
That fast .
I've never taken such a fast bus .
A Greyhound bus is air conditioned too and it has reclining seats .
I wish I could make a transcontinental trip by Greyhound bus .
Do you have any plans in mind .
I want to see some famous places in New York .
How are you going there by bus or by car .
By car .
Have you ever been to other countries .
No I haven't .
If I could afford it . I'd certainly take a trip abroad .
That's also my dream .
How about going to France next summer vacation .
Let's think about it .
I've been thinking it would be nice to go sightseeing next month .
Can you recommend something .
Would you care to go on a tour up to Canada .
Yes . That sounds interesting .
Please show us our itineraries .
We'll go to Niagara .
Are we going to climb the hill over there .
You bet . And we'll have a picnic on the peak , if you lik .
That's wonderful .
I want to see some famous places in London .
If we go on a package tour . We don't have to worry about accommodations and meal during the day .
Then I'd like to go on a package tour .
I'd like to see the sights of London .
If we take a boat trip we can enjoy the magnificent sights along the Thames .
It's the best way to see London .
I hear that you will have a journey .
Yes , I mean to climb the Baiyun mountain next week .
I wonder if you have visited Zhanjiang that is my hometown .
It is worth visiting .
No , I don't think I've heard of that city .
Is it near here .
No , it's just in the west of Guangdong province .
What's more , it has a very long coastline .
When I have time , I will visit the city .
Could you give me some information on your Australian tours .
Of COURSE . We have several package tours . You may choose from .
Wonderful what's the cost .
The price of a 10-day tour for one person is only $1,088 , which includes round-trip air tickets .
That sounds reasonable .
Let me think it over .
Okay . But don't delay too long .
Do you know where people like to spend their vacation .
Of course the seaside .
You are right . The seaside has its attractions for many people .
It's reported that the rate is rising .
Stevens . Do you think traveling is too expensive and it takes up too much time .
I don't think so .
Traveling enhances my experience and offers me chances to make friends with people from different parts of the world .
Can you maintain that relationship .
Sure .
3 years ago when I was in London , I met a girl from Singapore we visited the Tower of London and the St Paul's Cathedral TOGETHER we enjoyed ourselves very much .
2 years later . We got married .
Oh , that sounds so romantic .
Anna . I haven't seen you for ages , Where have you been .
I took a trip to the Hainan Island with some former classmates .
Did you enjoy yourselves .
Yes . Can you imagine we went swimming almost every day .
Wasn't it too cold to swim .
No , even though it was winter . The weather was quite Warm we just wore T-shirts , shorts or skirts .
Terrific .
We really enjoy the beautiful ocean scenery the tasty seafood the fresh coconut juice and the friendly people .
Where are you going for your Christmas vacation .
I'm thinking of traveling all over China , but I haven't made up my mind yet .
How long is your Christmas vacation .
2 weeks .
I don't think you will have enough time to travel all around China . I suggest you choose one or 2 famous scenic spots .
Thank you for telling me about that .
Then I'm going to Beijing Xian and Suzhou if time permits . I also want to visit Guilin .
Have a good time .
Thanks .
I hope so .
Have you ever been to Hong Kong .
Yes , I went there to visit my aunt last month .
What do you think of Hong Kong .
It is fascinating .
I'm impressed with its prosperity .
The skyscrapers , the department stores . The lovely parks and especially the Ocean Park are all wonderful .
It's a good place for sightseeing and shopping , isn't it .
Yes .
But everything is Expensive . It is also crowded even much more crowded than Guangzhou . I think .
What about the traffic .
It's very convenient to take the subways .
That sounds great .
If I have a chance . I will visit Hong Kong too .
Guangzhou is beautiful and the weather is marvelou .
After we check in at the hotel . Why don't we do some sightseeing .
I'd enjoy that .
What do you think I should see .
But I can't wait to see the Pearl river first .
Good .
Let's do that and some of the local sights today .
Look .
That's the Statue of Liberty .
What a spectacular view .
Maybe it is the most famous single monument in the USA .
It is it has become a symbol of New York and of the Usa for millions of immigrants . It was a symbol of the American Dream : It was a gift from the French People its designer also designed the world famous Eiffel Tower .
He was so great .
What was his name .
I am sorry , I can't remember .
The day when Lady Liberty was unveiled . More than one million people came to watch and celebrate .
That must have been very spectacular .
It was .
It has stood against the harsh sea air for more than 200 years .
In 1986 it was renovated at the cost of 70 million dollars .
By the way are visitors allowed to climb up the statue .
Yes , an elevator takes visitors to the top pedestal .
That's the first thing I'd like to do .
I suggest you include Ellis Island in your trip .
Ellis Island is a small island only a mile away from Lady Liberty .
There you could know more about the history of American immigration .
It was looked upon with dread by the immigrants .
Why was it .
Most immigrants could not speak English .
They had to wait their turn to be examined by doctors and officials .
They were afraid to be refused admission .
But it was the immigrants who brought prosperity to the land .
Without Immigrants the states couldn't be what it is today .
Here we are .
The second-largest city in the Netherlands Rotterdam .
It's not what I expected .
Where are all the old quaint houses like in Amsterdam .
Rotterdam was almost completely bombed out during the Second World War .
It was built back up from scratch after the war .
It does seem new and modern .
It is , but its history like Amsterdam's goes back many centuries .
After the war , the city planners decided to give it a modern look with shopping districts and broad avenues .
Rotterdam is the world's largest seaport , you know .
What .
You mean New York isn't .
Not any more .
Rotterdam handles more trade by ship than any other city in the world .
The Dutch have always been expert traders .
That's true .
It's a small country , but it's always been well developed .
Let's catch a concert tonight in one of Rotterdam's many theaters . Okay .
That's great .
Have you ever been to Sydney before .
No .
This is the first trip .
Could you tell me what to see here .
With pleasure , Sir .
There are too many attractions here .
How long will you stay here .
A week .
You'll find even a month or 2 isn't long enough .
So you can only visit some top attractions such as the Sydney Opera House Harbor Bridge .
The Sydney Opera House and the Harbor Bridge .
I've seen the Opera House . Many times in pictures and on television .
It's world-famous .
But you should also check out the native Aussie wildlife in the Taronga Zoo and the Sydney Aquarium and get a dose of Down Under culture at the Australia Museum .
Taronga Zoo Sydney Aquarium and .
And Australian Museum .
Also try to take time out to visit one of the nearby national parks for a taste of the Australian bush and if it's hot take your swimsuit and towel to Bondi Beach .
I can't catch all these names .
Can you write down these names for me .
Have you got a map of Sydney .
No .
It's available at the newspaper stand over there .
Let me accompany you there and circle out the top attraction for you .
It's so kind of you a map of Sydney , please .
Here you are .
Thank you .
Oh , the map is so nice that it offers the information . I'd like to know .
Yes .
Here is a suggestion for an itinerary of one week only .
Thank you very much . You've been most helpful .
Everything here is so new to ME and everything seems to be so vivacious .
Yes . Auckland is a city full of energy .
It is not merely a landing port but a good place to visit on vacations as well .
It has first-rate attractions .
And the cuisines are diverse and terrific .
Do you like the local cuisines such as the Maori cuisine .
Very delicious . I think .
It's incredible that many restaurants serve Chinese dishes too and they taste as good as those back in China .
It is said that there are nearly 1,000 restaurants in Auckland .
Incredible .
Is Wellington larger than Auckland .
No .
Auckland is the largest city in New Zealand .
But Wellington is the capital .
Auckland was the capital until 1840 .
Therefore Auckland abounds in museums , galleries and theaters It's a very important cultural city .
I hear Wellington develops very quickly .
Yeah , you'll see its charms next Tuesday .
It has come alive in almost every aspect .
It is a base to many national cultural companies and schools .
Does it have any museums or something like that .
Yes .
The Te Papa Tongarewa museum . Of course the latest major attraction .
And it has been built with a style scale and flair that much of the world is envious of .
Once you have seen or are about to see .
I seem to be in a dilemma .
I want to explore Auckland more while I can't wait to see Wellington .
The solution to your dilemma is to strictly follow the plan . We've made .
That's okay .
Melbourne is really a melting pot .
It is .
There are more people of Greek descent living here than in any other city in the world except Athens . Then there are the Chinese the Italians the Vietnamese and the Lebanese they've all added something to Melbourne .
It reminds me of New York .
They are quite similar in this respect .
In fact , almost a 3rd of Melbournians were born overseas or have parents who were born overseas .
Seeing people of different nationalities live together harmoniously is a real pleasure .
I plan to take some walking tours .
That's fine .
There are many attractions , we'll have to visit .
What are they .
Melbourne Zoo National Gallery of Victoria Queen Victoria markets and so on .
What's special about the Melbourne Zoo .
This place is a must-see .
This zoo was built in 1862 and it's the oldest zoo in the world and still among the best .
There are some 3,000 species of animals here , including the ever-popular kangaroos wallabies Koalas and wombats .
Are the animals caged .
Most animals are NOT locked up in tiny cages rather they are set in almost natural surroundings or well-tended gardens .
That's really special .
You are right it's rewarding to walk in the narrow streets .
The winding streets opened up a completely new world to me when I first came here 3 years ago .
The tidy rows of houses in vivid blues , greens and pinks led me into a colorful world .
It makes this trip more colorful too .
Thank you so much for your suggestion .
Seeing Chinese characters in a foreign country , makes me feel back at my comfortable hometown .
There It is a tea shop .
Almost every tea shop here serves Chinese tea .
Look Ahead that may be a Chinese temple .
No .
That's the corner of a Hindu temple .
Look over the roof line .
Steel and glass skyscrapers .
What a view .
It's quite different from what can be seen in the wide modern streets .
Yeah a walking tour in Singapore is actually a cultural tour .
You can see how closely different cultures merged while keeping their own features .
Perhaps that's the magic of Singapore .
The melding of distinct cultures from China , India , Southeast Asia and Europe has created a unique nation .
You'll see their cultural influences on every city block hear them in every historical account and taste them in very dish you are served .
Does the Singapore Explorer program include the narrow streets .
You mean the one-day tour by bus .
The bus does take you across some narrow streets , but before you know it . You may have come into the modern world .
It's really kind of you to accompany me here .
My pleasure .
What do you think about Bangkok .
I like the city very much especially its wonderful climate .
It's like New York in many aspects its prosperity can rival that of New York as can its pace .
It seems that you are very familiar with . Bangkok .
Yes , it's the 3rd time I've been here .
Its charms are so impressive that I've decided to spend 5 summer vacations on end here .
What about you .
This is my first trip HERE . I think I'm fond of the city .
It's a city of diversity .
Here you can enjoy the warm sunshine , like that of Florida the idyllic life like that of Guilin the modern culture that can match that of New York , London or Paris .
Some people say cultures are embodied in buildings and collections .
Yes .
As you know the buildings and collections here reflect both Western and Eastern cultures ancient and modern cultures .
And cultures are closely related to daily activities festivals and ceremonies .
Have you witnessed some of the cultural events here .
Not yet .
I arrived here this morning .
I recommend you include some of these activities in your trip and you can peek into the lives of the Thai people .
That's for sure .
Thank you .
You can call the tourism authority about upcoming traditional festivals and ceremonies .
Their number is 2 hundred and 82-9,773 .
Some of my fondest experiences have been the times when I've come to these occasions . Out of curiosity , only to find myself an active participant welcomed and encouraged by friendly Thai hosts .
That's an excellent idea .
I'd like to watch Thai boxing and a snake show .
That's simple .
You can enjoy both in the streets , parks or stadiums , you'll find them very wonderful .
I can't wait to watch them .
Yesterday I enjoyed the sightseeing of Los Angeles .
Do you have any tour to Disneyland .
Because my friend told me Disneyland would be a must while staying in Los Angeles .
Certainly , yes .
How much .
It depends on the type of tour .
$18 for Disneyland afternoon and evening . $14 for Disneyland by night , and $18 for all day Disneyland .
Is any meal included .
No it's not .
But can we have meals there .
Of course you can .
Cafeteria for example and the good restaurant of Disneyland Hotel are available .
Where can I join this tour .
Please be here and a tour guide will pick you up .
I see .
Let me think it over .
Thank you very much .
Could you tell me something about Disneyland .
Sure .
Is that where you're going .
That's right .
I'll visit it with my family .
I'll tell you what I can remember .
Thank you .
Is there a history museum in your city .
Yes of course .
When is it open .
Every day from 9:00 AM to 4:00 PM .
Isn't there a waterfall further on .
I can almost smell it .
Yes there is .
I remember it's not far from here .
Well let's drive down and see it .
Okay .
Have you ever seen a mountain like this before .
No .
In fact , this is the highest mountain I've ever seen .
Let's enjoy it while we can .
The views from the top of the hill are magnificent .
Yes .
We can even see a fine view of the lake here .
How beautiful .
It's really fascinating .
Did you go and see the Old Fort last time you were in New England .
Yes it was marvelous .
Well , tell me about it please .
Okay .
Good morning .
Could you tell me some places of historical interest in Nanjin .
Have you ever been to Nanjing before .
No , this is my first trip here .
I'm very pleased to suggest that you go to visit the Hongmei Garden Nanjing zoo the Yangtze River Bridge and so on .
Oh , great .
We'll have a good chance to feast our eyes .
Kali temple is much more mysterious than I expected its architecture trees atmosphere and .
And especially the people .
Yeah . They seem to be very pious .
They are .
They worship their gods . More than most Westerners worship God .
Look some goats are over here .
Oh the Goats are to be sacrificed to their god .
Let's go and look at the ceremony .
Okay . Where . Shall we go after the ceremony .
There are many attractions to visit here in Calcutta .
We'll visit the India Museum in the afternoon .
It is the largest and probably the best museum in India .
You know once Calcutta was the capital of British India .
The museum must be very grandeur isn't it .
Grandeur as it is , it is dusty and worse for wear due to lack of funds .
I'm sorry to hear that .
So many people living in such a small country is not easy .
It is reasonable that they should care for their stomach first .
Tomorrow , let's go to the Botanical Gardens .
You'll see a 200-year-old banyan tree .
It is claimed to have the second largest canopy in the world .
That's a good idea .
Look the ceremony begins .
Pyramids are great attractions for visitors .
They are a man made wonder .
I've seen them many times in textbooks and it's been my dream to see them with my own eyes .
Anything interesting to see here .
There're many places Frontierland fantasyland Tomorrowland and Adventureland .
What do you like best .
They're all fascinating .
Are there any scenic spots here .
Yes , there are many .
Would you recommend some .
I think Hyde Park would be a nice place to visit .
Do you see the ancient building .
Yes .
These buildings are very impressive .
These are beautiful examples of traditional architecture .
It's really worth seeing .
It's such an exciting place .
Everything looks different here .
There's so much to be seen here .
They've got some of the most beautiful things in the world .
Well , did you enjoy your trip to the beach .
It was fun .
Tell me about it . Will you .
Well , we drove through a beautiful valley on our way there in the morning .
It was a magnificent sight .
Did you stop at Niagara Falls for some pictures .
Sure , we wouldn't have missed it for anything .
You were lucky then .
Yeah , we had our picnic there too .
You should really visit the science museum while you are here .
It's absolutely fascinating .
Have you been there yet .
No , we're going in there tomorrow afternoon .
Well you'll love it .
And have you taken a bus tour .
That's the best way to get to know the city .
Not Yet but we hear that it's worth doing .
What about the zoo .
Have you been there yet .
Oh yes , that was lovely .
It's one of the nicest zoos I've seen , I think even better than San Diego's .
And if you are interested in art , you should visit the national art gallery It has a famous collection of Italian paintings .
Yes . I've read about that .
We should try to get there . While we are here .
And don't forget to try some of the local restaurants the seafood is great there .
Yes , it certainly is .
Last night we had fantastic clams .
Have you ever visited a redwood forest .
I've never seen a redwood tree . I really can't imagine how big they are .
The dictionary says they're the tallest living things Some are more than 350 feet high , but none of the trees in Muir Woods is that tall . You have to go further north in California to see the tallest trees .
You said that Muir Woods is near San Francisco .
I guess it must be quite an attraction .
Yes .
I've heard that many redwood trees are thousands of years old .
Are the ones in Muir Woods that old .
The oldest documented age for a coastal redwood tree is more than 2000 years .
The trees in Muir Woods are 400 to 800 years old .
Why do they survive so long .
They have remarkable resistance to forest fires .
The coastal redwoods also like a damp foggy climate .
Some people seem to feel that there is nothing much to do in Guangzhou for relaxation .
Do you find that .
Not really .
I often climb the Baiyun Mountain at the weekends . And when I have time , I visit a nearby city .
Oh that sounds lovely .
I wonder if you have ever visited Zhanjiang That is my hometown .
No , I don't think I've ever heard of that city .
Is it near here .
Yes , it's just in the west of Guangdong Province . It's quite easy to get to .
What kind of place , is it .
Well , it's quite a medium city . It has a very long coastline .
It's reported that the way people spent their vacation changed a great deal in the past 10 years .
Yes , 90% of people spent their vacation at home 10 years ago , but the figure has dropped to 40% now .
It seems that people are becoming more and more mobile and they want to explore the entertainment in the outside world .
But do you know where do people like to spend their vacation .
Of course the seaside .
You are right . The seaside still has its attractions to people , but the rate has dropped down .
It's also reported that the rate of camping is rising .
Yes . The reason may be that the real beauty of the nature is being rediscovered and people are getting more adventurous eager to get closer to nature .
Where do you intend to spend your vacation this year Mabel .
I'll spend my vacation at the seaside as usual .
Why do you choose the seaside .
I like swimming , you know .
Where do you like to go for your summer vacation this year .
I'll go to Beijing . As I did last year .
Why so .
It seems to me , I can never tire of historical sites .
They are attractive in all kinds of weather and at all times of the day .
That sounds very interesting .
Well , I've changed my mind .
I'll go to Beijing this year for a change .
Next week , I'm going to New York for a visit : What do you suggest . I see .
You should see the United Nations .
It is located in the middle of the city .
From there , you walk over to Broadway and a major movie or play .
I'm interested in schools and the courses they offer .
Then I suggest you go to Columbia University , and New York University .
They are 2 of the best schools in the city and they offer excellent courses .
What about Wall Street .
You should visit the stock exchange where all the stock transactions take place .
Do you have a map of the city .
Yes I do .
I can give you this one .
I suggest you stop at the Visitor's Bureau near the train station .
They have good maps and they can give more tourist information about the city .
Hello . Could you arrange a taxi for me in advance .

How about 9 .
That's kind of late .

I'll go and fetch Doctor Harrison .
Don't bother .
I'll drop in at his Clinic It's only a few minutes' walk down the street , isn't it .
Let me ring him up to make an appointment for you .
Acme Medical Center . Miss Carlson speaking .
Can I make an appointment for today .
May I have your name .
Hong .
Mr. Hong . Are you a patient of one of our doctors .
No , I'm not .
This number was given to me by the hotel .
Please come on over , and someone will see you .
It's a nice day . Isn't i .
We are lucky to have this fine weather for our trip .
Yes . Such a day is so rare in London .
I'm not used to this maritime climate yet .
It's too damp for me .
Same here .
What's the climate , like in Beijing , Lily .
We have continental climate there .
The rain falls mostly in summer when we need it most .
Autumn is the best time of the year in that ancient city when there's warm sunshine almost every day . Oh my goodness .
I'll make myself homesick . If I go on talking like this .
Don't go on then .
.
Here we are at last .
Look .
That's where the famous London Bridge used to be .
You mean the old Tower Bridge that kept falling down .
Yes .
Do you happen to know that English folksong London bridge is falling down .
I can't tell you unless you sing it to me .
Okay . Here it goes .
That's not all .
You only sang the first verse , there should be several more .
Please go on . Bob .
But it's the only verse . I know .
Where did you learn this British folksong anyway .
You are surprised that a Yankee like me can sing it , aren't you .
But you forget I happen to be a student of history and this folksong is historical .
How did you get to know it .
I learnt it from Joan an English friend of mine .
It's your turn to sing now .
I'd very much like to hear the other verses .
Please begin from the second verse .
I'm sorry to say if I could , I would , but I can't . So I won't .
Wait a minute .
I don't get it .
A second ago you said you knew the song and now you say if you could sing it you would . But you can't , so you won't all this rigmarole sounds like a Chinese riddle to me .
The reason is very simple . I sing out of tune you see .
Bad luck .
Happy journey agency .
Can I help you .
Yes .
I'd like to book a one way ticket to Shanghai .
By train or by plane .
By train .

I'd like to take a half-day tour around San Francisco .
What do you have available .
Well , we have 2 half-day tours daily .

There are 2 places . I really want to see .
One is the Fisherman's Wharf and the other is the Golden Gate Park .
The morning tour does include a stop at Fisherman's Wharf but I'm afraid our tours don't include the park .
You might enjoy going there on your own , you could easily spend a whole day there relaxing .
That might be a good idea .

Is there still from .
Yes there is .
Will this be for yourself only .
No , my wife and 2 children , will also be going .

Are there any Chinese speaking guides .
No . I'm afraid not , but we do have this guidebook it tells all about the places you'll see .
I think your English is very good .
But a professional Chinese speaking guide can make us understand London better .
I mean , I have some friends who can't understand English we'll go together .
If you prefer , we can get one from another agency .
We often help each other .
You see our Chinese speaking guides are all engaged .
With the betterment of the Chinese economy , many Chinese are rich enough to go abroad on vacation .
That's true .
We've received already 3 times as many Chinese this year as last year .
I can't come to a decision until I have consulted my friends .
Take your time .
Please take it free of charge .

The Summer Palace is divided into 3 sections . The halls for political activities . The living quarters and religious buildings Let's go up the hills first this way please .
Ladies and Longevity , it is the audience hall where state affairs were handled .
We're almost on the top of the hill .
From up here . We can have a bird's eye view of the lake .
What a magnificent sight .
Lin shall we have a boat ride on this .
Kunming Lake .
I'm very excited that I can visit Hangzhou SOON I first got to know the name of this city in Su Dongpo's work which says rain or sunshine fog or snow the West Lake in Hangzhou is serenely charming .
Yes . You know a lot about Chinese literature , don't you .
I'm doing some research on Chinese poetry .
That's great Hangzhou has always been known as the earthly paradise .
Lin , let's do the West Lake first . Okay .
No problem .
What a beautiful picture : It is a good time to jog on the Bai Causeway and Su Causeway .
Here we are . The solitary Hill .
It's just like a green crown of the lake , isn't it .
You've got better imagination .

Good morning , ladies and gentlemen .
Welcome to Beijing . I'm your guide you may call me Lin .
This is our first visit here we'll count on you for our short stay in Beijing .
Beijing is my hometown . So I know the city inside out .
I'll try my best to help you get to know the city and enjoy the scenery . You are in good hands .
How wonderful it would be that we could see all places of renown in Beijing .
Sure , but I'm afraid 2 days' time isn't enough for you to see all the places of interest in Beijing .
Then what places would you advise .
We're going to visit the Great Wall . In the morning and the summer palace in the afternoon the Forbidden City . The next morning and then we'll do some shopping in the downtown area . I believe it's the best route to take .
We're entirely in your hands .
You'll have a wonderful stay here .
So , ladies and gentlemen , let's get started .
Here we are on the Great Wall . Ladies and gentlemen .
It is a landmark which symbolizes China .
It must be pretty old I've heard of Qin Shihuang .
Is he the man who had different sections of the walls linked up .
That's right , and the Great Wall stretches . More than 5,000 kilometers .
Walls are usually viewed as a defense project . What are the key parts of the Great Wall .
It consists of 3 parts the military passes the walls and the Beacon towers .
Military passes , such as Juyong pass , the one we are visiting today are located at an important section of the Great Wall .
The beacon towers were used specifically for transmitting military information .
Soldiers used smoke in the daytime and fire at night to deliver the message .
Lin I found there are holes , both outside and inside the Wall . What's their function .
They were supposed to drain off water .
Lin could you tell us why the Palace Museum has another name Forbidden city .
Sure , the Palace Museum is the official name given by the Government of New China to the imperial palace of the Ming and Qing Dynasty .
It is where the emperors lived common people were not permitted to approach it . So it is called the Forbidden City .
I heard that gardens and buildings were numerous How did the emperors arrange those palaces Halls houses and towers .
The palace is divided into 2 main sections . The southern part which is the outer court was for holding ceremonies , while the northern one the Inner Court was used as the living quarters for the emperor and his family .
Look what a brilliant building it is .
Hall of supreme harmony is the largest Hall in the forbidden city many important ceremonies were held in this hall for example the celebration of the Spring Festival , the enthronement of an emperor or the celebration of the emperor's birthday .
We're now in the Inner Court right .
The bulletin tells us that this building is called the Palace of heavenly purity .
Yes . This is the central building in the Inner Court where the Ming emperors used to live .
And here is the palace of earthly tranquillity where the emperor and the empress had to spend their wedding night .
Where did Empress Dowager Cixi give audience behind a screen .
It is in the east chamber of the Hall of mental cultivation .
Ladies and gentlemen . We're going to take a rest in the Imperial Garden and you can also find pavilions rare flowers and ancient pines and cypresses .
When people talk about Suzhou its unique style of gardens will often be their first topic .
You mean the gardens there are widely reputed .
Exactly humble administrator's Garden lingering Garden the Master of Net's Garden Garden of harmony are all world-famous .
What's so special , in the style that makes gardens in Suzhou different from any other gardens elsewhere .
It is the way ancient architects lay out things in the gardens that makes them unique .
I know there are towers terraces trees and ponds , in the gardens .
Besides gazebos winding corridors watch side pavilions rockeries and Grottoes are also standing side by side with them .
I'm really curious about how they were Arranged Chinese workmen were so creative that they made thousands or even more vistas in those tiny gardens .
Yes . Their work is marvelous and in Suzhou , there are other historical sites .
The popular haunts are Hanshan Temple Tiger Hill gentle waves Pavilion and Lion Grove .
It will be a satisfying trip there I believe .
So do I .
One of my friends told me , You can't be reckoned to have been in China , without seeing the Qin Dynasty figurines , so that's why I am here in Xi'an .
Some people call them the 8th wonder of the world because they marvel at different features and facial expressions of terra cotta warriors and horses .
Is the number 1 pit the largest one in the cemetery .
Yes it IS : it lies to the east of Qin cemetery .
How many Warrior figures and chariot figures are there in all .
More than 6,000 they queue up in a battle array of 38 columns .
Look at them .
Some warrior figures are carrying bronze swords , some holding catapults bows and arrows and long spears .
And in 1980 . 2 bronze chariots were unearthed from the western side of the Qin Shi Huang's tomb each chariot has 4 bronze horses and a bronze figure Driver the beautiful artistic design and exquisite casting skills are fantastic .
It's incredible . You should set up a gigantic museum of the Qin Shi Huang mausoleum .
You're right , that's what we are doing right now .
Is there any other places worth visiting in Xi'an .
Yes , there are plenty of Them . We have here the big wild goose Pagoda as well as the small Wild Goose pagoda Ming Dynasty city wall and Hua Qing hot spring .
Are there any tours for the Silk Road .
There are several tours of the Silk Road .
Have you been to our tourist information center .
No I haven't .
Would you show me where it is .
Sure .
It's up ahead to your left .

Yes , it's a great way to really see the desert .
Besides , it's great exercise too since we do a lot of hiking .
That sounds fantastic .
Where do I go . Sign up for that tour .

Tell them you want to go on the tour that goes into the desert .

Would you like to see the rest of the house .
That would be nice .
Let's start upstairs .
Hello , Joan .
Oh it's Lily .
Are you surprised to see me .
Well , yes .
I thought you were working hard in your room as usual .
No , not on Saturday evenings .
They are evenings for rest .
And all the other evenings are for work .
Oh what a workaholic you are .
I've come to watch the TV news .
It'll be on in a few minutes .
I'm glad you are interested in current affairs but every morning you only read the headlines in the papers and that's about all you care . As far as the WORLD is concerned .
As a matter of fact , I was rather fond of watching the telly during my first month in London .
But after watching some of the series for a few weeks .
I found they were all more all more or less the same .
Don't you think so .
Yes , the hero is always an almighty detective or spy or cowboy and there's got to be one or 2 most alluring women who fall in love with him and sleep with him .
And there's endless shooting and fighting robbery and theft , as well as car chases .
I'm sick and tired with them too .
Let's go to the cinema some day for a change .
Shall we .
All right .
But let me warn you beforehand . If you go to the pictures . You won't find them much better than most of the TV series .
We can pick a good film .
What about a film that's won an Oscar reward .
That's not a bad idea .
When there's a really good one on . I'd love to go to see it .
Lily you promised Mr. Grey . The other day not to work terribly hard any longer but I haven't found much change in you so far .
You can't expect anyone to change his or her way of life . All of a sudden .
Can't you see I'm trying hard to relax .
That's good .
Would you like to go window shopping with me tomorrow morning .
Yes I would very much like to , but let's not go to the West End , or any other posh shopping centers .
Shopping in the West End .
Oh no , not me .
Unless there's a big sale in one of those expensive shops .
I don't want to go shopping there even when there's a sale on unless I suddenly become a millionaire or billionaire .
That was a wonderful meal .
Well , I'm glad you enjoyed it .
Now how about some ice cream .
That would be lovely .
Thanks for everything .
I had a wonderful time .
We certainly enjoyed having you .
Let's get together again , shall we .
Great idea .
Thanks so much for having me over . I had a great time .
It was our pleasure .
Now I'd like to present the world's greatest Peking opera singer to you .
Here is Kang Li .
Oh , no , no .
I'm not prepared I can't sing .
Oh come on .
Nobody expects a professional opera singer at a barbecue party .
We're here just for fun .
I'll play a few jazz tunes next .
So come on Mr. Li .
All right .
Now let's give Mr. Li a big hand .
Come on in and make yourself at home .
Thank you .
I'd like you to meet my wife Helen .
Can I get you a drink .
Thanks .
Do you have Scotch .
Yes .
Can I get you a drink .
Yes , thank you .
Well how about a glass of sherry .
That sounds fine .
Would you like something to drink .
Sure . Thank you .
Bloody Mary . All right .
That would be fine .
Help yourself to a cigarette Lily .
The cigarette box is on the little table over there .
No thank you .
I don't smoke .
Would you like a drink .
I have Scotch whisky as well as sherry for ladies .
Which do you prefer .
I'm afraid I have to say no . Thank you again .
I'm practically a teetotaler .
Really .
There's a Chinaman living in this boarding house .
Like you . He doesn't drink or smoke . I mean he only has beer , but never any alcoholic .
Are all Chinese student great saints like you 2 : I wonder .
No , certainly not .
In any of the Chinese colleges you would find a few students who drink like a fish and smoke like a chimney .
But among the workaholics . I don't think there's any alcoholics at all .
I guess that's the case with students all over the world .
By the way the Chinese student in this House , said he might have met you once in China .
What's his name .
I can't pronounce his surname properly but I know it's the same as the English word sun the sun in the Sky . It sounds funny when I try to say it .
Is it Sun .
There is such a Chinese surname , but I can't think of anyone I know by this name .
Never mind .
If you come to a dance in this House on Friday night after next you'll meet him .
Would you like to .
Yes , very much .
I'm looking forward to it .
Looking forward to the dance or to meeting Him .
Both .
Let me remind you Becky you've promised to go to the theater with me some day .
Have you forgotten .
Of course not .
Shall we do it sometime next week .
Just as you like .
Let's do a play a matinee preferably .
What play . Shall we go to .
Have you got today's papers .
There's no use to go over the newspaper ads .
I have 3 in mind already .
That's good .
Let me hear what they are .
First of all , Shakespeare . What about Hamlet .
It will be on next week at the open air theater in one of the London parks .
That sounds interesting .
And there's the Mousetrap It's a thriller by Agatha Christie , which has been on in London for years .
The 3rd one is the Death of a Salesman .
It's by the famous American playwright Miller , isn't it .
It was staged in Beijing a few YEARS ago I saw it and enjoyed it very much .
Well , that leaves us only 2 choices now .
Incidentally , I'm planning to go to the Stratford on Avon festival in the summer holidays .
What a coincidence .
I've been thinking of doing the same thing .
Let's go together next summer vacation .
That'll be fine .
Well that strikes out Hamlet leaving us The Mousetrap only .
Going to The Mousetrap .
Oh no , not me .
I don't want to be trapped either .

The tenor Luciano Pavarotti , who was born in Modena , Italy and lives there with his family recently celebrated 25 years in opera and he continues to grow and enrich the medium .
Each season he regularly adds a new role to his repertoire either for the stage or on records as well as new songs to his recitals .
He has given performances in the great music halls of the world and his success encompasses concerts television recordings and films .
Yet Pavarotti also makes time for aspiring artists .
In addition to his master classes . He has organized an ongoing international vocal competition with the opera company of Philadelphia appearing in performances with the winners .
The parents of Victor Hugo's sweetheart disapproved of the young author and forbade their daughter . His Company even his mail was stopped , and the pair were at their wits' ends .
But Hugo was not to be outdone , he got busy on a novel and spurred by love completed it in record time .
The novel was sold and as goes without saying was read by the girl and her parents .
The plot was Hugo's sad plight and the parents' despicable attitude .
After that he saw her .
When Samuel Johnson first met Mrs. Porter , who later became his wife he was taking pains to impress upon her the fact that socially , he was nothing to boast about .
To drive the point home . He said he had no social standing , no money and had one uncle , who had been hanged .
Mrs. Porter , not to be outdone replied . And I , sir , have no standing , no money and while there are none of my relatives who have been hanged . I have at least 50 who deserve hanging .
For years I had wondered what the last day would be like .
In January 1976 after 2 decades in the top echelons of the British Security Service MI5 , it was time to rejoin the real world .
I was determined to make a new life for myself breeding horses out in Australia .
I went back to my office to sort out my safe .
I turned the dials on the lock and swung open the heavy safe door .
In front was a mass of registry files stamped Top Secret and behind them a neat stack of small combination boxes .
The remaining boxes held papers gathered after I joined the counterespionage department in 1964 when the search for spies in British intelligence was at its most intense .
One of Hong Kong's best known couples Brenda and Kai bong Chau tell of their most romantic Valentines' gifts to each other .
It was back in the '60s in the early days of their courtship when Brenda was at a convent school in England and Kai bong was studying at Cambridge University .
Owing to student penury Kai bong could only afford a string of fake pearls but he presented them in a heart-shaped chocolate box on a heart-shaped velvet cushion he had specially made up .
Brenda in turn painstakingly knit Kai bong , a black sweater with his initials in white .
Brenda's knitting skills were none too advanced however and the jumper turned out somewhat ill-fitting .
It was treasured nonetheless and the Chaus still have it to this day .
Reversal of fortune starring Jeremy Irons and Glenn Close is based on one of the most notorious murder trials of the last decade .
Sunny von Bulow , a high society heiress lies . Even today , in an irreversible coma .
Did her European aristocrat husband Claus von Bulow inject her with insulin inducing a coma .
Was he a maniacal murderer or was she a drug ridden neurotic woman who attempted suicide .
This dramatic film attempts to reconstruct the bizarre real-life drama .
Based on the book by Alan Dershawitz Claus von Bulow's defense lawyer and a noted . Human rights attorney , the film does not give any answers . But it does get you thinking and forming your own conclusions .
Produced by Oliver Stone , who won Oscars for Platoon and Born on 4th July . It is an enthralling film with excellent performances .
When Caroline moved to her present job she really thought she was starting to go places in her chosen career of public relations for a major financial institution .
She became manager of her own small department with a team of 2 and a secretary had a hectic round of foreign travel to fit into her busy schedule and felt she was heading in a clear direction .
3 years later she's in exactly the same job . The travel has become a bit exhausting and the chances of promotion never seem to come her way .
Her glittering career now has a decidedly tarnished feel about it , and she seems to be stuck .
When she looks elsewhere , she appears to have out priced herself and what's on offer either pays less offers less of a challenge or both .
Jane is a very successful deputy manager in advertising sales of a magazine publisher .
She has worked hard to get where she is today . But now she feels she has run out of steam .
Making that next move up the ladder , just seems a bit too much like hard work , and after all , she has a nice job and life style already .
Her confidence in her ability to move on , has hit an all time low .
If what these women are going through strikes a chord with you , you're experiencing a common phenomenon you've hit a career block .
And while there's little comfort in knowing others are in the same situation . Looking at similar cases can help you to identify some crucial factors that may be holding you back too .
As you know , my surname is Sun , which is spelt exactly like the English word sun .
This caused me some trouble during my trip to England . As you will see later on .
Before the journey I have to go to the British consul's office for a visa .
When an English man asks you about your health . He is probably only doing so out of politeness .
Unless he knows you have been ill he is certainly not expecting a detailed medical report and will be most surprised if you give him one .
Cigarettes are rather expensive in the UK as they carry a heavy tax .
It is therefore a good idea to buy some duty free ones on the plane , or ship before arriving .
The customs allow approximately 200 to be brought in by each person over the age of 17 .
Shops and restaurants do not allow customers to use their office telephones , but some have telephone boxes and there are boxes in the street and in public buildings .
When giving numbers to an operator read each figure separately .
Zero is read as the letter . Oh .
When the same figures occur together the word double is used .
886,103 is Double 8-6 1 .
Some of the telephone services available are emergency calls to the fire brigade , police and ambulance service for which you should dial 999 .
ADC which stands for advise duration and charge means that when the call is finished , the operator rings you back to tell you how long the call was and how much it cost .
Directory Enquiries give information about members both in the UK and abroad .
Personal calls are made to a particular person .
A fixed charge is made for the service , but you do not pay for the time taken to find the person .
If he is not there . The call is tried again later without further charge .
Transferred charge calls are paid for by the person receiving the call rather than the caller .
In business telephones are answered by giving the name of the firm private telephones are normally answered by giving the number only .
When inquiring about a room . It is always a good idea to ask at the beginning whether laundry and heating are included in the price .
If you want to share a flat look in the flats to let column of an evening paper for advertisements like 4th girl shr. s c H'stead flt.01 134-2343 evenings .
This means that a 4th girl is required to share a self-contained flat in Hampstead and that inquiries should be made by telephone in the evenings .
For ages and ages the Yellow River has been rushing to the sea and the Great Wall has been creeping towards the ocean .
It's the seas and oceans which have linked all the lands , all the people and all their hearts .
The play tells you a story about some ordinary people in the world and the friendship between them .
It begins in Beijing .

For many people . Easter is a time of high festivity a time for playing traditional games dancing and of course feasting upon all the food associated with this particular time of year .
It all began centuries ago when the resurrection of Christ brought great joy to followers of Christianity .
People the world over started to indulge in all forms of revelry , which ranged from traditional games of egg rolling to the partying of recent times .
Popular customs associated with the time of Easter take a variety of forms Easter eggs later became very prominent as symbols of new life and resurrection .
Today they feature as decorations and as presents exchanged between friends and relatives .
As regards the menu offered at Easter parties although there is no traditional fare to compare with the Christmas turkey or goose a favorite dish on many Easter lunch table is roast lamb .
For a TEA Party a hostess would probably fill her table with hot cross buns and Simnel cakes without which no Easter tea table is complete .
Easter table settings are often based on the conventional Easter colors of yellow and green .
And for the finishing touches fluffy yellow chicks white rabbits and white lilies all bring home the festival spirit of Easter .
Many couples choose to acknowledge their love for each other on Valentine's Day .
We often give our loved one a token of our appreciation . At this time .
Love tokens , have been given since time immemorial . Some more extravagant than others and some quite unique .
The movie industry has . Needless to say , provided some classic examples of very special love tokens .
The mercurial relationship between Richard Burton and Elizabeth Taylor was marked by many extravagant and romantic gifts .
In 1964 when Burton finished filming The Night of the Iguana he gave charming Elizabeth a gold dolphin chip with diamonds emeralds and sapphires , which he called the iguana .
Perhaps the most famous royal love match this century was that of the Duke and Duchess of Windsor .
He ordered many different pieces of jewelry from Cartier to give to his beloved Wallis .
Whether it's romantic extravagant or simply different . There's no better way to celebrate your love than with a gift on Valentine's Day .
Father's Day is a day set aside for honoring fathers in church services and at home .
It is celebrated in the US on the 3rd Sun. of June .
This idea was originated by Mrs. John Dodd .
In 1909 . She persuaded the Ministerial society of Spokane , Washington to salute fathers with special church services .
In 1924 President Coolidge recommended national observance of the occasion to establish more intimate relations between fathers and their kids and to impress upon fathers the full measure of their Obligations the red or white rose is recognized as the official Father's Day flower .
Korean meals can be particularly heart-warming the camaraderie builds up as the meat sizzles on your table .
Spice , of course , is a strong factor chilies and pepper form basic seasonings in almost all Korean cooking with garlic and sesame adding richness .
The barbecue literally fire beef is the best known aspect of this cuisine our meal began with top grade us short ribs and a plate of assorted meats such as beef , pork and chicken .
The well marinated slivers cooked quickly on the table deliciously touching the tongue as they went down .

Australians , however , are not always spectators for the sake of enjoyment ALONE They are also enthusiastic participants as well in betting money on horse and dog races , which is legal .
The federal government runs a betting agency called the TAB where you can make your bets .
There is one extremely famous horse race in Australia called the Melbourne Cup .
Nearly everyone in Australia bets on this race usually only a very small amount of money just for fun .
When it is time for the race . Many people stop working and watch the race on television or listen to it on the radio to see who wins .
In 1970 , 1,971 , over $1.6 billion was betted far more than the total of all cash grants made by the Australian government to welfare service beneficiaries that year .
Slot machines and a number of other gambling machines were popular .
Ever popular with interior decorators and increasingly popular as a collector's item Japanese screens can be a wonderful and valuable addition to your home .
With considerable talent . The Japanese have converted the functional screen into an art form .

Though originally from China folding screens came to Japan by way of Korea .
At first , the paintings were executed on separate panels of silk and paper .
Hinged by simple leather ties . The pictures showed landscapes palace scenes human figures , animals , birds flowers and grasses often with symbolic significance .
The Dragon Boat Festival is the most important celebration of the Miao people who live along the Qingshui river in southeastern Guizhou province .
Every year between 30,000 and 40,000 Miaos participate in the festivities .
In the eyes of the Miaos the dragon is a symbol of good luck .
Girls like to adorn their hair with silver ornaments shaped like dragons and wear clothes embroidered or woven with dragon patterns .
The Miaos build exquisite dragon boats , which are in reality a body formed from 3 canoes one large and 2 small that are strung together .
Before a dragon boat sets out somebody sings an auspicious song to the Boatmen wishing them a good voyage .
The Miao Dragon Boat festival differs from the Han celebration .
They are not celebrated on the same date . While the Hans only hold dragon boat races during the festival , the Miaos take the opportunity to visit friends and relatives .
Young men set out in boats early in the morning .
When they approach a village they fire guns to announce their arrival .
The villagers set off fire crackers in response and then go to meet them . The hosts present 2 cups of rice wine to each man and then tie gifts for their relatives ducks geese and colored silks onto the heads of the dragon .
Horses races and bull fights are held during the festival .
Girls in holiday dress dance to the accompaniment of drums .
It's not unusual for young people to meet their future spouses at the songfests held on festival nights .
Income is a very important factor in the Australian society .
Relatively speaking , the distribution of income in Australia is fairly even .
This perhaps is because Australia emphasizes its equalitarianism and takes it as a kind of tradition .
Despite this the incomes of businessmen , or professionals rose more rapidly than those of Labour workers , especially in the postwar years .
The same is also true of skilled workers and unskilled workers .
Generally speaking , the average male is more likely to get a job in the manufacturing wholesale and retail trade or services industries .
Women comprise around 40% of Australia's total workforce .
According to a survey the occupations with the highest prestige are physician university professor , lawyer architect , engineer large business owner and manager dentist and clergymen .
And those occupations , such as porters night watchmen waitresses Packers and street sweepers are regarded as the bottom of the scale .
Education is an important factor in determining occupational status .
The most highly regarded occupations are often professional and white-collar jobs with higher income , but requiring higher education .
In contrast the bottom most occupations that require little education consist entirely of unskilled manual workers who get relatively less income .
Although Australia is not as wealthy as the United States and Japan . Most Australian people live a fairly good life .
An ordinary Australian is secured a $120 per week . If he can find a job .
And this will be enough for a small family .
If a couple works hard for years they are soon to have their own apartment with a garden cars and sometimes even a small size swimming pool .
Besides , there are various kinds of social welfare facilities and life insurance which help the jobless . The retired the handicapped and the children without parents .
In a word Australians do not have many worries over their lives .
As a result , they often have enough efforts and financial support to choose to enjoy themselves at any time .
They give top priority to their holidays and will always put away everything to enjoy .
This perhaps is rare in the world .
If your idea of a winter holiday is soaking in as much sun as you can and giving free rein to your spirit of adventure on windsurfing and parasailing trails then the Bahamas could turn out to be your dream holiday .
Situated off the southeastern coast of Florida . In the US the Bahamas are a large group of islands in the Atlantic Ocean , whose scenery mainly comprises isolated beaches and coves swaying palms steep cliffs and dense jungles .
Because of their location in the tropics . The islands enjoy a sunny climate throughout the year and have hence been aptly named The Isles of perpetual June .
Nassau on the island of New Providence is the capital city and most popular destination of the Bahamas .
If your preference is for historic and colonial charm head for Nassau if glittering casinos and bargain shopping are your idea of fun then opt for Freeport . But if you just want a real get away from it all break where you can be on your own any of the serene Family Islands would be ideal .
Whatever you choose , you'll find that The Bahamas is a splendid destination .

Starting this month . The country is bedecked with cherry blossoms as tourists from far and wide flock to the various viewing spots to be in harmony with natur .
It is also the time in Japan for festivals when some of the most colorful and traditional festivals associated with the season's flowers are celebrated .
Japan is a land of varied charm it has something for EVERYONE particularly enchanting are the off the beaten track places that are well worth visiting an added bonus being that they are less frequented by tourists .

Doctors often insist on appointments being made before they receive patients during the daily surgery hours .
Foreigners taken ill or involved in accidents while in the UK are entitled to free medical treatment under the British National Health Service .
It is possible to obtain emergency medicines from certain chemists after normal shopping hours .
If the shop is closed . Look in the window for the list of chemists who are open late on that particular day .
A fixed charge is made by the chemist . In respect of each prescription at present . This amounts to 20 pence , regardless of the value of the medicine .
If you regularly take a certain drug it is as well to remember that it may not be available in the UK , except with a doctor's prescription .

Films may be left at a chemist's shop for developing .
It is not customary to tip the girl who shows you to your seat in a cinema or theater .
Handsome Husky green eyed Patrick Swayze has had female fans swooning in the aisles since he starred in Dirty Dancing .
His credibility as an actor soared after playing the role of Orry main in the highly successful television mini-series north and south .
I still feel closer to Orry than for any other character I've played , says Patrick . It wasn't just his morality and integrity I admired but also the romantic lifestyle clothes and horses .
He also had a passionate belief in what's right and wrong . A code of honor if you like .
I believe those qualities are important in real life and I reckon . A lot of people who watched the series on TV believe that too .
Patrick admits that it was probably north and south that helped him towards more powerful and dramatic films like a smash hit Dirty Dancing .
He leapt to fame in it .
His latest film is the romantic thriller Ghost .
In it , his co-star was the stunningly attractive Demi Moore .
Who can forget the godfather or the Godfather : Part 2 .
Both these powerful films based on the best-selling novel by Mario Puzo won the Academy Award for Best Picture of the Year receiving a total of 9 Oscars and 21 nominations .
Francis Ford Coppola completes the trilogy of the powerful Corleone family with The Godfather Part 3 , starring Al Pacino Diane Keaton and Talia Shir .
Al Pacino once again plays Michael Corleone , now in his '60s and yearning for spiritual redemption .
Coppola describes the film as the story of a kind of American royal family attempting to legitimize itself .
We are dealing with themes related to power succession revenge redemption and lov .
He says the story line of this film was inspired by news stories about the role the Vatican played in the billion dollar collapse of Italy's Banco Ambrosiano the attempted assassination of the pope and the revival of Europe as an economic power .
Commenting about the relationship that the Corleone family forges with the Vatican Coppola says I have always been fascinated by the effect of pure wealth pure power . The Corleones want to be legitimate The Vatican is legitimate and also a separate state that can move money around the world .
With Coppola at the helm once more . Watch The Godfather walk away with the Oscars again .
Coppola's company has always supported independent filmmakers and emerging talents to produce innovative cinema .

The right haircut is all important when it comes to looking and feeling your best .
So what's the latest in hair fashion .
Checking at the top hair dressing salons around Hong Kong . The word is out on the look for the '90s .
For a head start into the first spring season of the decade care is the trigger word .
New styles are less carefree with a definite line but more versatile than the natural trends of the past few years .
You never get a second chance to make a first impression .
New acquaintances may judge on what they see . While older ones tend to reevaluate their opinion on your ability to continue looking smart .
This can pose a problem for the working woman I. E finding the time to keep looking good .
Easy styling gave women freedom from slavish time consuming hairdos and twice-weekly visits to the hairdresser .
Fashion dictates for the '90s put the tailored look at the top of the list of things to wear .
Design trends demand a well groomed more finished look for hair and makeup .
Luckily , women are now more educated in what makes them look good .
Hairstyles . For the '90s reflect the ever changing role of women in the workforce .
In control more than ever before working women are conscious of their overall image .
They work hard and play hard and need a hairstyle that keeps pace but one that gives polish to their total look .
Barbers expect a tip of about 20% on a normal haircut but since most of them like to talk to their customers . The foreigner has gotten good value for his money in the form of 20 minutes' conversation practice .
Value added tax was introduced in April 1973 to bring Britain into line with other countries in the European Economic Community .
As well as the main post offices in town centers . There are numerous sub-post offices in suburbs and villages .
These are often inside grocers' shops or general stores .
Post offices also offer a form of banking service , known as the Post Office Savings Bank .
This is useful as money may be withdrawn from any Post Office in the UK on production of a special savings book .
One way of sending money through the post inside the UK is to buy postal orders , which may be cashed at any of the post offices in the country .

A word processor is like a typewriter with a built-in eraser copier scissors and glue .
We can edit replace or move the text after it is typed in .
To use this word processor , you'll have to turn the computer on put the program disk in drive 1 and the work disk in Drive-2 .
Load the program first and name the document you wish to work on .
For Japanese work processing . You will also have to load the JUDUGO dictionary .

I give my boss a printout of the data I have entered so that he can check for errors .
If I do not save the file regularly I risk a complete loss of data , if the program crashes .
A database is like a filing cabinet .
The files are like drawers the records are like individual folders and the fields are like individual bits of information in the folder .
Yesterday I accessed the database to find how many tons of steel . We have produced so far .
I searched the database for all records containing the heading steel production and removed those records to extract data .
Each record had a field showing production in tons so I totaled those .
My favorite database program is the mail merge program that contains all the customer addresses .
After typing a form letter in the word processor this program adds each customer's name , address and heading to a copy of the letter and prints them all out .
The fields in this database can be sorted either alphabetically or by date of entry .
Electronic mail is just instantaneous mail .
Instead of sending letters and documents on paper in envelopes letters are sent as bits of electrical energy transfered through telephone lines from one computer to another .
Mr. Andrews asked me to log on to the telecommunications network and see if any electronic mail from Japan is waiting for him .
I uploaded a letter to their terminal in the head office and then downloaded a list of addresses from their database .

I think it'd be a good idea to see the representative now .
I have to attend a meeting with the General Managers .
It'd be much better to put it off till tomorrow .
We're so busy today .
You look worried .
I'm expected to finish it before . 5 o'clock .
But it's already 3:30 . And I'm afraid I can't manage .
I've got a fantastic idea , we can put an ad in the newspaper .
Will it work .
Are you feeling okay .
Do you want to see a doctor .
I'll think about i .
Mr. Black asked me to change our project a bit , but I've got no idea now .
You could talk it over with Joe .
He is good at this kind of work you know .

Nice to meet you to .
You know what .
John got a promotion .
Yeah . He worked very hard and he made i .
Guess who I saw just now .
Who .
Mr. Lee . The man who used to work here .
How's he doing .
What's the matter with yo .
How come .
You were here in the office . Most of the morning .
Hi , Mike .
What's new with you .
Nothing . Same old thing . What about you .
Alive .
How's your child .
He's really doing well .
You don't seem to be yourself . Today , Jim .
I got a dressing down from the boss .
Kate , you know what I wish .
What .
I want to quit the job and travel all over the world .
May your dream come true .
But you'll have to work till you get enough money .
Excuse me . Where's the manager , please .
Sorry , I've no Idea but he'll be here this afternoo .
Hot in here isn't i .
Want me to open the window .
I'll do it right away .
Don't bother . Let me do it .
There should be air conditioning , don't you think .
Excuse me , can I ask you something , Mr. Jones .
Okay , go ahead .
Do you happen to know Mr. Johnson in the sales department .
How was your weekend Tony .
It was Wonderful we climbed the mountain and camped on the top .
Sounds grea .
I have some good news for you , Jack .
What is it .
You're going to get a raise .
Where did you hear that .
Don't you think that the sales are not as good as befor .
Yeah , it's because of the economic recession .
Maybe something is wrong with our strategy .
Do , excuse me , Mr. Green , may I ask you a question .
What is it .
What time do you think you can talk to Mr. Lee .
I'll be free this afternoon . Let's make it 1 o'clock this afternoon .
Sorry , I couldn't help overhearing did you mention Mr. White just now .
Yeah . Wh .
He's going to be made , manager of the department .
Wouldn't you say that Mr. Lee is nice .
Yes .
Every time we have a problem . He's always ready to help .
No wonder he's so popula .
Wouldn't you agree that there should be stricter rules .
There's too much waste .
Speaking of partners , have you ever done any business with the guys in Bright Star .
They're honest and trustworth .
You mean they're reliable . Righ .
Now that you mentioned it , I have to tell you , I'm planning to quit .
Why .
I don't think I can manage .
Come on , you can do it well .
It's strange you should say that because I was thinking of it myself just now .
What's your opinion .
I agree with yo .
We should apologize for it , even though the customer is very picky .
Apology won't do any harm to our image .
On the subject of the marketing . I don't think John's idea is practical .
He doesn't know our Chinese customers .
But he's experienced .
He really is in AMERICA . But don't forget this is in Chin .
What a coincidence . I watched the program too .
What do you think of our manager on TV .
Marvelous .
Funny you should say that .
I'm going to visit him in perso .
It's very kind of yo .
That reminds me : I saw may crying in her office . The other day .
Perhaps she knew in advance .
I wonder why she was Sacked it's unfair .
Sorry to interrupt , but did I hear you say Paul won't attend the training class in Sweden .
He's got to finish his project .
What a shame .
He's the only person who shouldn't miss it .
About the holiday I think Egypt is the ideal place .
Have you ever been there .
No , but let's consult the travel agency .
Okay let's consult the travel agency .
Talking of sports I like golf best .
I'm interested in it , but I can't play wel .
How about playing this weeken .
I'll show you how to play .
You mentioned Paris just now .
Well it's a romantic place .
Never but I'm planning to go with my family this year .
I'm jealous of you .
Sorry about that , are you . All right .
Yeah . Do be careful next time .
Did you bring the documen .
Oh , NO I forgot .
Oh well you'll better bring it to me tomorrow .
1,000 pardons for having given you so much trouble .
Never mind .
I'll certainly pay more attention next tim .
That'll be great .
Try to do better next time .
Don't worry , I'll let you have another one .
It's very kind of you .
Oh my fault for the mistake .
Let's forget It that can happen to the best of us .
Sorry , Peter .
The trouble is that we have to change the lock .
I won't be that silly again .
I forgot to bring you the document .
I'll make sure you have it tomorrow .
Listen carefull .
I've got to go and see the guest OFF . It won't be long .
No problem , I'll be waiting for you here .
That's all right . What made you so late .
I was tied up with some urgent business .
I'm going to bring my colleagues with ME . I hope you won't mind .
Not at all . The more the better .
It Doesn't Matter What is it .
I've got 2 questions to ask you .
I'm afraid I've taken too much of your time .
It Doesn't Matter , I'm not busy anyway .
I apologize for what I said just now .
Don't think more about it .
And I do appreciate your concern .
I hope we can understand each other better . In the days to come .
I had to take my little sister to the hospital . You know .
There's no reason to apologize for such a trifling thing .
I certainly will try to make up for it .
Forget it .
I must apologize for the delay .
Apologies are really unnecessary .
We haven't been fully prepared anyway .
Thank heavens .
It's not really Important I'll write another one .
It's all my fault .
I can't tell how sorry for giving you such a fright .
There's no need for you to feel sorry we're quite all right .
Do you like classical music .
Yes , very much .
It has unfailing charm , doesn't it .
I think so .
Don't you like thrills .
No , not at all .
Why not .
They're very exciting .
I think it's frightening rather than exciting .
What color are you fond of .
Dark blue .
Oh my favorite color is green .
Do you like football or basketball .
Football .
Are you keen on Dancing .

Salads .

I'll take you up on that someday .
There's nothing I enjoy more than sightseeing .
I'd rather stay at home watching TV .
Don't you want to go sightseeing for a change .
No , definitely NOT it's too tiring .
I like all kinds of sports , especially swimming .
You look like you are in good shape .
I like reading novels best .
What're you reading now .
Jane Eyre .
I like drama .
I'm reading Hamlet now .
I'm fond of watching TV .
But I think it's a waste of time .
I don't think s .
I always learn something from it .
What do you like to do in your spare time .
What I most enjoy is reading .
Reading is fun .
I have the same hobby .
Tom had an accident yesterday .
Fortunately , it wasn't serious .
What's the Matter With John .
His business went under .
That's really tough .
Yeah . And it's a pity we can't help .
I hear your brother is seriously ill . Is it true .
Yeah . He was down with a bad cold . A week ago .
That's a shame , it really is .
Is he all right no .
Much better .
John had a heart attack last night .
Oh really .
Is he all right now .
Not so good , though he was taken to hospital in time .
Poor old John I'm ever so sorry .
Oh , what a shame .
What is it .
Peter sprained his ankle just now .
He's got to be more careful .
I faile .
How awful .
I should have been prepared for it .
Don't be upset . I'll help you with it .
James' wife passed away .
How terrible for James .
Yes he loved her very much .
I'm sorry to hear you were seriously ill .
I never imagined that I could be so sick .
Are you all right now .
Not really .
My boss told me I wouldn't have a holiday this summer .
It's a sad thing .
Yes . I'm tired of doing the same thing . Day after day .
You must have been very annoyed when you were reprimanded .
No , not at all .
I'm to blame for my carelessness .
It's too bad .
Jim was going to pick up your friend but his car broke down .
How was your trip .
My flight was delayed for 2 days .
Oh what a dreadful thing to happen .
Old Peter retired recently but he just cannot bear to stay at home .
I'm most upset to hear THAT he can do something many old people are living a rich and full life .
Yes , but he has to learn to adapt himself to this kind of life .
I'm sorry to inform you that your director has cancer .
Is it curable or not .
It's incurabl .
I'm terribly sorry to hear that there's no hope .
I have some problems in my work , Mr. White .
Is there any way I can help .
Yes . Would you explain this part to me .
This is the most difficult period I have ever experienced .
I've lost my jo .
You have my deepest sympathy at this difficult time .
When are you going to attend your mother-in-law's funeral .
Tomorrow .
You have my sincere condolences .
I was okay in the university straight A's all the time .
And you were excellent in today's interview too .
I'm very happy to tell you that you've got the chance to work in my company .
Please accept my sincere congratulations .
Your product is so favorably received .
Allow me to offer my warmest congratulations on your success .
I really appreciate your remarks .
I hope you'll have much more encouraging achievements .
You've finished a very difficult operation Dr. Johnson .
Yes . This operation was really a challenge to us .
I must congratulate you on your success .
It's very good of you to say so .
We're told that you will take charge of the sales department .
Yes , but it hasn't been announced yet .
So I'd like to be the first to congratulate you .
It's very kind of you to say so .
I'm going to take charge of the engineering department next month .
You've been working hard . May I offer you my congratulations on your promotion .
Joe , what do you think of my plan .
You are doing very well .
I'm flattered .
I lost an important file .
Don't be scared .
Do you remember where you put it last .
In this drawer but it's missing now .
Let me check again . Oh , here it is .
Thank you so much .
What happened in your interview today .
I failed .
Don't let this get you down .
I'm sure you will find a good job .
You look upset .
What's wrong .
I failed the competitio .
Cheer up boy .
I believe you'll do better next tim .
I heard you've been promote .
Keep up the good wor .
What a nuisance .
What's u .
I've tried several times but the computer won't work .
Come o .
Let me give you a hand .
So many people have entered their names for the contest .
You don't mean you want to give up .
I don't think I will win .
Have a try . You Can Do It .
Tom , you did a good job in the negotiation .
I think there's a lot to learn .
I wish I could do as wel .
I couldn't help it .
Try again .
John . Have a look at my project .
Tom helped me a lot .
Both of you did just fine .
This is a big project .
I'm a bit nervous .
Don't worry , I'm right behind you .
Glad to hear that .
This is the 3rd time I've made the same mistake .
There is no reason to lose confidence in yourself .
Be careful next time .
Peter's bought a new car .
But they managed to talk his wife into buying the car somehow .
Bill . Where's the new pen you bought last week .
I lost it .
I don't believe a word of it . Tell me the truth .
Michael lost $20,000 gambling .
That's incredible . That's all he has .
It's really a disaster for him .
You're to be appointed as Sales Manager . Congratulations .
It's too good to be true . You must be kidding .
It's true . It's very , lucky for you .
I'm not going to work with you and go on with the experiment .
You're not serious . Are you .
We've cooperated very well . Up till now .
Sorry but I've already decided .
That's too bad .
But why .
I can't credit his account of what happened yesterday .
He's trying to talk us into believing in his innocence .
Mike you're late agai .
My sister was ill , so I .
Do you think , I'd believe a story like tha .
Well , the truth is I overslept .
It's reported that we must be cautious about earthquakes nowadays .
I have little confidence in what the newspapers sa .
They're never reliable .
The ad says . One must do exercise with their equipment to keep healthy .
I don't have great belief in ads . What they really want is to get more money out of your pocket .
I think there's a point in what you sai .
Look out .
You must have run over something just now .
That gives me the creep .
I'm worried sick that the documents won't be found .
There's no need to Worry the policemen are working hard on i .
I'm really in a flap about the interview .
Take it easy .
You're well prepared .
I really need the job that I can't afford any mistakes .
I'm sure you'll pass it .
I'm scared that The Boss will let her g .
Is it so serious .
Sure it is .
I was scared stiff of giving my first tal .
Were you .
It was well receive .
Thank you for your kindly words .
I dreamt of God last night .
Did you say hello to him .
No , I was afraid to talk to him in case he would find out our dirty business .
I don't know what to do if I fai .
Don't worry so much .
It's a large sum of money . I can't afford to lose i .
Do you like snakes .
Of course , NOT I'm afraid of the .
I mean do you like to eat snake meat .
I'm afraid . I'd feel sick at the sight of it .
I stayed with my friends .
You should have given me a call .
I met my uncle yesterday .
That's nothing special .
But my uncle died years ago .
Oh STOP I'm really terrified of those kinds of storie .
I was terrified out of my mind when the respectable board chairman was found to be a murderer .
I'm frightened to fly for the first time .
What about you .
Well , I found it very exciting .
I'm really terrified to witness the slaughter .
COME ON : You Won't witness any slaughter . It's a movie .
But it's a movie that reflects histor .
I'm worrying that she may be lost .
Relax , she'll be all right .
But she has such a poor sense of directio .
Okay . Let's go out and look for her .
Saying you wanted to kill yourself you scared me out of my wits .
I was making a joke .
That's too much .
It's a worry to me whether she's able to deal with the matter .
I think she will .
She's not a greenhorn any longer .
I'm not so sure .
Did you hear that the subway would be attacked by terrorists .
I never believe those stories .
I came across it in a leaflet found in town .
I must admit I was rather disturbed to read about it .
I fear for the biddin .
Just relax .
There won't be any problem .
How can you be so sure .
Did you enjoy your trip to Afric .
Yes it was very excitin .
Anything special .
Well , a lot .
Once I was petrified to see a huge rhino bearing down on me .
Serious pollution in modern cities gives some cause for concern .
Yes , we're breathing poisonous air every da .
I think it's time for the government to take actio .
I absolutely agree with yo .
Do you mean this drug will clear up my troubl .
That isn't exactly right .
What do you mean by that .
I mean this medicine will only relieve your pain .
Why didn't Henry turn up at the meeting .
He must have got tied up at the offic .
No , that isn't SO I met him in the elevator just now .
Do you know . Tom , in the sales department .
Yes .
He's a man of medium Height he wears glasses and has a moustache .
But that isn't quite correct I think he's a tall man .
What's the result of the computer test .
I'm sure John has got a high mark .
As a matter of fact , he didn't pass the test .
It's really out of my expectation .
Bob is working very hard and he even offered to work overtim .
As far as I know he lost a large sum of money in gambling . He's working to pay off his debts .
He gambles .
You've taken me by surprise .
I'm sorry to have interrupted you What did you say just no .
I said that no one has the right to impose his views on others .
Jimmy , have you heard that Tom has been fired .
But I'm not sure you're correct about that . I heard he's been transfered to another department as a marketing manager .
Why are you so depressed .
Because I can't find my Camera maybe I've lost it .
Well , the fact is that you didn't lose it at all , you put it in my bag at noon , remember .
Oh yes .
Look how expensive the printer is .
I think you might be mistaken .
Why .
Because this price tag is for the computer .
What shall I d .
I think I've got enteritis , it's so painful .
If I may say so it's actually not the case . It may be nothing but a slight infection .
Are You a Docto .
No , but my wife i .
Have you got a lot of Chinese antiques .
Yes . How about this one .
It doesn't strike my fancy What's more , it doesn't seem to be genuine .
Oh , I'm sorry but I really should point out your guess is not correc .
What's this . And what's tha .
Do you know .
This is a magpie and that's a Nightingale .
If I may . Correct you , that is not a nightingale , but a golden oriole actually .
Tom . What's your opinion about the meeting .
It was a sheer waste of tim .
Tom , to my knowledge you slept rather well . During the meeting .
Can you cover my phone calls . When I'm ou .
Of course , where are you going .
I'll pay a visit to Microsoft .
No . Only 10 minutes' walk .
Tom time for lunch .
Hungry .
Oh yes .
Let's go to the lunch room .
Are you going for coffee .
Yes . Would you like me to get you a cup .
Yes , thanks , black please .
Jane , could you do me a favor .
What can I do for you .
Have John ring me if he comes back .
John , could you come here for a moment .
Sure What's up .
I can't find my fil .
Let me see .
There it is .
Oh , thank you .
It's 5 o'clock .
Time to call it a day .
Shall we leave now .
I wish I could , but I have to finish the work .
Can I do something for you .
No thanks for askin .
Did you hear that the meeting was postponed .
No. who told you .
Mary .
Where do you want to have lunc .
It's up to YOU . I've no preference .
Do you like Italian Noodles .
I'll bet John will be appointed as our new boss .
I'd be glad if it's true .
What do you think of him .
He's capable .
What do you think of my new dress Miss Wang .
Wow , you look very elegant today .
I'm glad to hear that .
But not for long . It's noisy outsid .
Okay . I just want to let in some fresh ai .
It could have happened to anybody .
But I really feel depressed .
Cheer up , it's not that bad .
Maybe it's a blessing in disguise .
Cheer up .
Better luck next tim .
Don't think any more about it .
Could I help you in any way .
I think your ability will guarantee you a better job .
I've just been given notice .
And I want you to know how very much I have enjoyed working with you .
Joe . I'm really sorry that this happene .
Not having you have will be a real loss and I will miss you .
Thanks for stopping by .
How are you feeling today .
Not very well . I'm feeling cold .
You don't look too bad . Just take it easy .
I wanted to come yesterday when I heard you were sick .
Thank you for coming all the way to see me .
I really hope you are feeling better soon .
Do you feel better this morning .
Don't pani .
We have very good doctors here .
How are you feeling this morning .
Yes I do .
But I'm afraid that something will go wrong .
Don't panic , we have very good doctors here .
It's a lovely day , isn't it .
Sure It's quite clea .
I think it'll continue to be fine .
It sure will .
Fairly warm this morning isn' .
You're right . The air is so warm and everything looks so fresh and green .
How wonderful it would be to walk along the river .
I like this kind of weather .
Yes , a little breeze and a lovely moon .
And it's calm . I like the peac .
It is a glorious day today .
I agree .
It's nice and bright today , isn't i .
Yes , the autumn is marvelous here .
Tomorrow will be fine too . I think .
I hope so .
The sun is shinin .
But there're some mare's tail .
That's a sign of win .
Oh really . I thought it was a sign of rai .
Look : It's a clearing u .
I can see the sun now .
I like summer as long as it's bright like this .
Anyway I dislike the summer here . There's too much rainfall .
It's getting warm toda .
Yes , it's much better than Yesterday but I still feel chilly .
It's fairly warm for this time of the yea .
What lovely weather .
It's so pleasant after the bad weather . We've been having .
Let's go out and enjoy the fresh air during the break . Oka .
Marvelous idea .
What a heavy thunderstorm just now .
But the rain is letting up .
Look : What a beautiful rainbo .
Yes it's sunny again .
Look at the Dark Clouds , I think it's going to rain .
That's what is technically cumulonimbu .
What's that .
The clouds that produce thunderstorms .
It doesn't look promising today .
What does the forecast say .
They say it will be fine today .
But there're already snowflakes falling .
It's pretty cloudy , isn't it .
Yes . It's getting dark .
I feel suffocated .
It's going to be a heavy rain .
Gosh . The rain is so heavy .
Heavy .
It's raining cats and dog .
The cold is simply awful I'm freezing .
We're going to have a cold spell I hea .
You mean it'll get even colder .
Yeah .
It's too sunny outside .
We'd better stay i .
Look It's raining again .
It's been like this for a couple of weeks .
I wonder when it'll clear u .
The weatherman says it'll last for 4 more days at least .
I'm freezing it's terribly cold these days .
The weather forecast says there will be hail tonigh .
I wonder when the cold spell will pass .
It says the spell will last another 6 days .
I can't stand the cold her .
Neither can I especially the wind .
The North Wind is biting and I'm frozen to the bone .
Look , the snow is setting in .
What beautiful snowflakes .
It must be wonderful to play in the sno .
Yeah I enjoyed playing in the snow . When I was a child .
Excuse me , John , does the number 23 bus go to Holiday Inn .
Are you sure .
Yes . I'm positive about i .
Hey John's promoted .
I doubt it .
He's a quiet guy and not good at socializing with people . How could he win favor from our bos .
But you forget he's a very efficient guy .
It's a nice idea , isn't it .
But I don't think it'll work .
Anything wrong .
It's impractica .
John's plan is appealing , isn't it .
But I'm afraid it's too radical .
What about Mary's .
Oh . Her idea deserves more attention .
He doesn't like your pla .
So what .
There's no better idea now .
He never likes others' ideas and he never has any ideas of his own .
You should do nothing of the sort . You're my guest .
We're not talking about business .
Let's compromise a little then How about making it a Dutch treat .
What is that .
We each pay our own bill .
What do you think of the product .
I will never buy it .
Why not .
The design is attractive , isn't it .
The design is all right , but it hasn't passed the quality Test . I'd rather we didn't put it into the market now .
Excuse me , Mr. Wang .
What can I do for you .
Is there a post office around .
Yes go 2 blocks down the street you can't miss it .
Are you sure of your ID number Mary .
I think this is the right number .
That's it . Fill out the form please .
Hey , what's going on here .
Ann hurt her Leg we're taking her to the hospital .
Let's go together .
Did you hear that . The National Bank was robbed last week .
Yeah .
How on earth did they manage to do that .
God know .
What did Mr. Green come here for .
Maybe he just came by and dropped in on us .
I wouldn't mind knowing about his real intention .
Elizabeth is in a very difficult situation . You know tha .
Yes , I've heard about i .
I'd give a lot to know more about it .
She is in love with her boss , but her boss is not REALLY serious he's going with another girl .
Did they find a way . At last .
Yes they worked out a plan .
I'd love to know about it .
But they want to keep it a secret .
What's in your mind . Cind .
You haven't moved a bit for a long time .
I'm homesic .
Oh COME ON your holiday is coming .
Can someone tell me about the young man .
We only know he's a relative of the director .
No wonder he behaves so differently .
The criminal who had killed 3 cops escaped last nigh .
Yeah , I got it from the newspaper .
Did they catch him at last .
No , he's still at large .
The Human Resource department says that 4 employees will be laid of .
Yeah . But Don't Worry you're definitely not one of the .
But what I'd really like to find out is what kind of employees will be sacked .
I suppose it was dangerous to start the program wasn't it .
I don't think so .
They have made full preparations .
You seem to like the newcomer very much don't you .

Because Orange is much more to my taste .
Going to the cinema or staying at home watching TV , what's it to be .
As far as I'm concerned , staying at home is more comfortable than going to the movies .
But it feels so different to go to the movie .
How do mark and John compare in your opinion .
Generally speaking Mark's personality is much more agreeable than John's .

For me , the best thing is to relax at home .
Do you prefer working as an employee or being your own bos .
As far as I'm concerned , the best one is the latter .

Well , nothing is easy .
I favor the Chinese team over all the other .
I don't think it's the best one though .

Which is your preference tea or coffee .
My choice would always be tea .
When did you form this habit drinking tea .
Since I came to China .
Do you have any plan for your future .
I'd prefer to go abroad . Now , if possible .
Many people want to go abroad nowadays it seems to be a trend .
I just want to further my education in the States and then come back to China actually there're more opportunities here in China .
We've got everything ready .
Shall we start now .
Best thing would be to have the check agai .
Yeah , you've got a point there .
Where would you like to have dinner .
I don't care , as long as it's a Chinese restaurant .
You don't like western food .
I really find Chinese dishes more to my taste .

Tom says he's going to the bank tonight .
He also says he's going to kill the president .
It's ridiculous isn't i .
To tell you the truth , he says whatever comes into his funny head .
Oh my God .
Good heavens . I thought I saw our boss in a car on the way here .
Isn't he in the States .

All this routine work really Browns me off .
Oh COME ON you've just started .
I wish I hadn't chose this jo .
Bother the flies .
Where do they come from .
I don't know something rotten here .
I can't see it .
Do you like our new manager .
I'm fed up with this endless talk .
You can't say tha .
He's a well informed perso .
I can't see it .
What do you think of working as a secretary .
I'm not at all keen on that sort of job It makes me craz .
You have to type all day .
That woman is a thorough drag .
She sneezes all the time .
Maybe there's something wrong with her nos .
That guy's manner really turns me off .
Yeah .
He never stops asking stupid questions .
Maybe he's just dumb .
Rock music really leaves me cold .
I'm crazy about it .
Then tell me what's good about i .
It can't be expressed by words .
Driving during the rush hours can be a bit of a bind .
Yeah I think so . You have to be patient and careful .
I'd rather walk or run to work .
You must be jokin .
Typing really bores me to death .
Do you have to type every letter .
Yes , I'm doing the secretarial job .
Do you like watching footbal .
I don't find it very exciting .
Maybe you haven't found the magic .
I'm really sick of waiting for buse .
Yeah . Especially when you have something urgent to do .
But a taxi costs too much .
That's true .
I find Beijing opera is quite a bore .
Young people enjoy pop songs more .
Beijing Opera is all Greek to me .
But you don't have this problem with pop songs .
I'm tired of dancin .
But to me it's really enjoyable .
Maybe it's because you always have pretty girls as your partners .
What a boring film .
The acting of the heroine was too artificial .
And the plot was too simple .
What a bother having to climb so many stairs every day .
But it's also exercise and it's good for your healt .
I don't care .
You're complaining again .
I must admit , I'm not at all interested in math .
I'm sure you'll soon begin to like it . It's such an interesting subject .
But I don't think I'll ever like it .
What're you supposed to do now .
The only thing for me to do is to get on the bandwagon .
Yes . Best to go along with i .
What did he think about the boss's decision .
He Wouldn't disagree . He's learned to swim with the tide .
Everybody has to do that in this society .
You'd better water down your demand .
Or The Boss will turn it down at once .
Don't argue any more let's meet each other half way . Okay .
All right . It's good for you to say to .
Only in this way can we close the dea .
Things are becoming so difficul .
So I hope everyone of us will make the best out of a hard bargai .
Yes indeed .
Do you want me to do it or leave it as it as .
I don't mind one way or the other .
I should know better than ask you for advice .
We must figure out a way to settle the dispute .
Yes . Something has to be done .
But it's not easy .
How on earth will they end the strike .
They'll have to give in , on both sides . I thin .
But neither of them wants to .
Then the strike will last forever .
Are you in favor of this pla .
Not really , but we've finally decided to play along with his ideas for the time being .
What do you mean by that .
We agreed with him temporarily .
I think we'd better reach a compromise .
Unfortunately , I don't think there's room for compromise in this matter .
It seems we'll never reach any agreement .
We shouldn't dress very formally for the occasion .
Yeah , we should be casual when we stay with these people .
When in Rome do as the Romans do .
Did you finally work out a compromis .
No , we couldn't .
They wouldn't give IN neither would w .
I find it hard to get on with my colleague .
You need a give and take attitude to get along . In this firm .
Thank you for your advice .
If we want to reach an agreement , we should make mutual concession .
You Said : It as long as we do that we'll reach an agreement .
That's righ .
What's the result of the dispute .
We finally settled it amicably .
Just as I expecte .
Their charge is a bit too high .
You have to split the difference .
That's the thing to do .
Will our boss agree to change the plan .
No , he's still taking a hard line he has ordered us to finish our work , according to the schedule and he'll never change his mind .
He's really tough .
Yes when he announces a plan , all of us fall into line .
You never reject his ideas .
Never reject his idea .
Never he's the boss , you know .
I finally backed down on my plan .
I thought you would stick to i .
I couldn't simply because so many people have different opinion .
Come here Joe Let me tell you something bad .
What is it .
You'll be put into prison .
Come off it .
Let's cut tomorrow's work and climb the hills . Okay .
Don't be so silly .
Mr. Green will be mad at us .
I'm only joking .
Linda is a trustworthy friend of mine .
I can't agree .
She talks about you behind your back all the time .
I think there's sure to be a nuclear war in the coming century .
I wouldn't say that .
If that were true , people would be inviting self destruction .
Then why are so many countries eager to develop their own nuclear weapons .
Let's wait here a moment .
I don't like the idea of waiting at all .
What do you think we should d .
Go straight to his home and call for him .
I think capability is the most important quality for an employee .
I hate to disagree with you , but I still think honesty is even more importan .
Working hours should be flexibl .
Don't you think so .
I wish I could agree with you , but it's only suitable for some jobs .
China will eventually become a superpower in my opinio .
I'm afraid I can't agree with you there .
Chinese leaders have already said China will never be a superpower .
But things will change . You know .
Other countries may but I don't believe China wil .
Is Joe in .
Don't talk to me about that fello .
We quarreled yesterday .
I can't stand his rudeness .
How annoyin .
Someone took my briefcase by mistake .
What a nuisance .
The weatherman says it'll be cold tomorrow .
I expected to go picnicking with my family .
That's the limit .
What's the matter .
I've told Paul several times to knock at the door before coming in , but he's forgetting things all the time .
Have you talked , your plan over with Smith .
Don't talk to me about him .
His indifference really irritates me .
Why on earth . Don't you tell me the truth .
Well , I did .
I want to see your manager .
Oh , damn it .
What's going on .
I might have left my paper in the restaurant .
Don't worry .
Just go and ask the waiter if anyone has it .
We have to work overtime this weekend .
Oh no .
I've had just enough of it too .
Have you read the notice on the board . Mr. Wang .
No . What's it abou .
There's a meeting this afternoo .
This is the 3rd meeting this Week . I'm fed up with them .
You shouldn't be so rude to her .
None of our business .
I simply can't bear to see you behave so badly .
Why are you upse .
Bob asked me to revise my plan .
You know , I've been working on it for the whole afternoon .
It really makes me mad .
Let's see if I can be of any help .
What a fool .
Who are you talking abou .
Peter .
He told my secret to Ann .
I really hate being betrayed .
Watch : Out don't cut your fingers .
It's not sharp at al .
Better be careful .
Mind , the wet paint .
When was it painte .
It was just done yesterda .
Watch it .
You'll knock the glass over .
Oh , it's your favorite glass .
No , I'm just afraid you'll get hurt .
Leave the dog alone .
It might bite yo .
Be sure not to try to read a girl's min .
But that's my favorite hobb .
You must be in trouble all the time then .
Don't touch that Flowe .
Because that kind of plant is poisonous .
You'd better not buy stocks these days .
I think it's a good investment .
If you don't follow my advice you'll lose your shir .
You're too close to the Fireplace . Be careful of your clothes .
Thank you for your warning but my clothes are made of asbestos .
That's fabulou .
Don't try any tricks .
Someone cheated last time and he got away with it .
He'll answer for his dishonesty some da .
How did he get involved in it .
You stay out of it and mind your own business .
Be careful not to stain the papers .
They're not so easy to stain .
Look , I've already got one stained .
Be aware of those who fish in troubled water .
Are you giving me a hint .
Well , I'm just reminding you of your experience last year .
What did you think of his behavior yesterday .
He doesn't seem to be so bird-brained .
He must have been annoyed by something yesterday .
I'm fed up with all this treatment .
We have to bear it since we're employees .
Who says employees can be maltreated I'd rather leave this company .
I can't stand her arroganc .
She looks down upon everybod .
Maybe it's her nature .
I'll let her know I'm not the one to be bullied .
I think you'd better leave her alone .
It really makes my blood boil when this sort of thing happens .
Don't be so ANGRY it's passed anyway .
I can't forget it .
You'd better cool dow .
What on earth does he mean .
Take it easy .
He's driving me crazy .
You'll get used to him soon .
Why are you holding your nose .
I just can't stand the odor it stinks .
Why not open the window .
It's even worse outside .
I simply can't bear your barbaric behavio .
Don't pretend that you're so good .
You should feel ashamed of yourself .
I really hate waiting .
I'm sorry I had something urgent to deal with just now .
You should have told me earlier .
It was too late to inform you .
Look here . What a mess he's mad .
Maybe he didn't do it on purpose .
But this indifferent attitude irritates m .
He's always like this .
I'm very annoyed at your rashnes .
I did mess it up .
You should have asked for my opinion before you do it .
I will next time .
I wish you wouldn't be so selfis .
Selfishness is just human natur .
But you should at least consider others .
Don't be so angry with him , he's your colleague after al .
But he doesn't treat me as an equal .
It's just a misunderstandin .
He's never satisfied with anything I say or do .
What are you doing . Jack .
Computer games It's interestin .
What's that .
What a brilliant sta .
Look there one more .
How beautifu .
Why don't you just stop talking and watch .
Please ask . When you take my things next time .
Don't be angry , I'll pay you double when I get rich .
By the time you get rich I'll be crazy already .
I'm coming to the end of my patience .
Why's that .
They keep on disturbing me with their problems .
They turn to you because they trust you .
John I've told you twice to throw these papers AWAY . Why are they still her .
Don't be cross .
I just thought you might need the .
The thing that really annoys me is that you don't take my words . Seriously .
I'm not at all pleased by your negligence .
We feel terribly sorr .
Apologies . Don't get the money back .
Why did she marry a man old enough to be her father .
You'd better mind your own business .
I'm just curious .
Do you think she loves him .

I mean is it legal to have 2 wives or 2 husbands . At the same time .
Definitely no .
But in the past a man could have as many wives as he please .
It was true of religious groups in America , years ag .
I'm told a man can have many wives in some countries even nowadays .
That's ridiculou .

What do you think of my plan .
Sorry , I didn't quite follow you .
Let me explain it agai .
This is not what I had in my mind for our project .
And what do you suggest .
I think this part should be omitted .
We're scheduled to meet Mr. White on Thursday .

Well , I'll get Tom to give you a hand .
Hello , this is Wang Li .

I've no objections at al .

I agree .
What would you suggest .
I've no idea .
You can ask Jane for help .
We should have a non-smoking office .
What do you say .

I'm afraid you'd better talk with the smokers first .
I think it'd be a good idea to play tennis after wor .
Don't count me in .
Why .
I have to finish the project today .
Remember the meeting this afternoon .
It'd be much better to put it off ill tomorrow .
We're too busy today .
You look worried .
What's going on .
I'm expected to finish it before . 5 o'clock .

I've got a fantastic idea , we can put an ad in the newspaper .
Do you think it will work .

Leave it to me .
You don't look very well these day .
I feel very tired .

We must spike that rumor .
Do you know that Mr. Johnson was arrested for bribery .
Don't believe the gossip you heard .
It's already been in the newspaper .
Laura must be having an affair with our boss , otherwise she would not have been promoted .
That's not true . She has worked harder than all the rest of us put together and earned her promotio .
She is hardworking but .
You are setting yourself up for a big slander lawsuit if you keep this up .
Laura has earned every bit of the credit . She's received .
So cut it out .
You said you would let us know about the factory plan today . I wonder if .
Come to my office in 5 minutes and I'll talk about it with yo .
Do you still remember what we talked about last wee .

Just tell me the truth .
You borrowed $200 from Jack last month and he needs it badly .
Oh , I'm really sorry .
Do you see what I mean .
I'm afraid I'm not clear yet .
Do you mean you will not give me your suppor .
Shouldn't we consult the other .
George , can I have a word with you .
Yes , pleas .

Alice , can you get my fax .
Mr. Smith , I've done it many times .
Now I'm very busy . I wonder if you can take mine for me .
Tomorrow is your birthday Jane isn't it .
Thanks for your kindness . But I prefer to celebrate my birthday quietly at home .
Oh that's too bad .
You have a big salary , John .
More than my boss , thinks it should be , and less than I want it to be .
Whenever I mention your salary you always try to avoid it .
This is not an acceptable question and it's nothing I care to discuss with yo .

I thought you would tell how really happy I a .
Can you tell me something about your romance Jimmy .
Oh , I think you all have much more exciting lives than I do .

There's nobody really special in my life right now . Although I have a lot of friends I enjoy spending time with .

Are you getting divorced Elizabet .
I'm very sad about i .

Lily Mr. Smith told you to go to his office .
Mr. Lee . I hope you'll continue to use my first name when we're alone but company rules are that we use Mr. Or Mrs. Or Ms Or miss when other people are around .
Jack is very snobbish .
He's totally warm to our boss but cold to us .
I don't like comments that belittle peopl .
Can we talk about the football match .
He must quarrel with his wife , very often .
How can you draw such a conclusion .
Because he's very easily agitated at work .
He's a neighbor of mine .
I'm under the impression that he and his wife live a very happy life .
I hear your boss is very hot tempered .
I'm afraid . What you were told about him is not quite true .
If you could meet him in person , you'd probably like him .
I hope to meet him soon .
Did you see my file Alice .
Jane working with you is like living with my old roommate . She was a very nice girl but never emptied her ashtray or washed her coffee cups .
Could you clear up before you leav .
It's a lot easier for us to find things if they are put away .
Have a cigarette . Please .
No , thanks .

Mr. Kaneda just made a joke about the condition of the factory .
He said it was unbelievable that a soap plant could be so dirty .
He is using an unusual northern dialect , which is why everyone is laughing .
It's difficult to translate that word directly into English , it's an expression we customarily use to start a meal .
It means something similar to : let's have this .
Let me paraphrase what he said . Like this .
I'm sorry but I'm not familiar with the term spandex .
Since it seems important to this discussion . Could you explain what it means . Before I translate what you said .
You'll find a post office on the left hand corner of the next stree .

I think that's quite a good thing to do .
Then I feel relieved .
Do you favor my proposal .
I think I would go along with it .
I'll report it to our manager .
Would you mind telling me your position on the problem .
I can see no reason to disapprove of establishing a computer center .
Does that mean you'll agree to give us the money .
I didn't say that .
He's a talented designer isn't he .
He sure is .
The problem is that very few people really appreciate his work .
I'll strongly recommend his new design .
He's lucky to have you back him up .
Do you like the new design .
It's just the thin .
Swell .
I'm so happy you like it .
The next thing we should do is to carry it out .
Can I assume the adjusted agenda meets with your approva .
I must say I find it quite reasonable .
So I can make the following arrangements according to it .
That's righ .
I think we'd better cancel tomorrow's meeting .
It's sensible idea I think .
Let's open the Window It's really stuffy in her .
You have a point ther .
But you'd better put on your coat , it's still col .
Thank you for telling m .
Would you like a smok .
I've quit smoking .
You're smart to quit smoking .
But I simply can't however I tr .
We're too slow .
Could we speed up a little .
That's just what I'm getting at .
Dalian is a beautiful city .
It sure is .
No other city can match it it's heaven .
Well if you live in other cities long enough , you'll love them just as much .
Boxing is a brutal game wouldn't you say so .
I guess I woul .
It's just too cruel .
Yes indee .
Cigarette production should be banned , wouldn't you agree .
Absolutely .
If no one produces them people won't smoke , that's for sure .
You said it .
I think he's a promising young man .
I guess you're righ .
Maybe one day he'll become another Bill Gates .
Let's wait and see .
I think modern painting means nothing .
I think so too .
It's just pointless .
Then why are so many guys so crazy about i .
Either they're crazy or we can't understand art because we've been engaged in business management too long .
The painting exhibition is worth Visiting do you agre .
I suppose I do .
I've got 2 tickets here will you go with me at the weekend .
Sure . Thank you .
Don't you think that wives should obey their husbands .
I suppose that's true or there won't be peace at home .
But many people in the West . Don't think so .
Frankly speaking , I like the traditional Chinese or Japanese family .
Chinese children are too spoiled these day .
Yes , I believe so .
We American parents are not so lenient as some of you .
I think it's time we took some strict measures .
As the old saying goes , spare the rod spoil the child .
Some of the employers are too hard on the employee .
Yeah I AGREE but some employees need to be discipline .
Maybe you're right , but I think they should show respect for the employees .
A pickpocket took all my money .
Don't you agree that all the thieves should be punished by cutting off their finger .
I couldn't agree more .
In that case there wouldn't be so much theft .
Definitely .
I've been promoted John .
Lucky old you .
But you really deserve i .
You've been working very har .
Your speech is smashing .
Oh , do you really think so .

Thank you for saying So it was our first project here .
I hope I can see more of your work .
We'll try our best .
That was quite a meeting .
I do appreciate your courage .
I thought your speech was excellent .
I'm glad you think so .
It was really a challenge to speak before the general manager and members of the board .
But you made it .
I think your dress is beautiful .
It's very nice of you to say so .
My boyfriend chose it for me .
Your boyfriend really has an eye for clothes .

How very nice of you to say so .
You're very talented Indeed , I'm sure you'll make a successful designer .
Aren't these glasses beautiful .
Yes , they really are .
But they cost me a fortune .

I admire your courage , Mike .

A wedding ceremony .
You're kidding again .
Your typing has improved tremendously Jack .
And you've got no errors this time and you finished in almost no tim .
I can hardly believe i .
My compliments on your memor .
It's very nice of you to say so .
How can you remember such a long telephone number after dialing it only once .
If you dare report it I'll kill you .
Don't you dare .
Just you try .
You'll regret making such a decision .
I'll never regret it .
You Will you wait and see .
I'm sorry to tell you that I'll have to fire you .
Just you try .
What a mess . You've made here .
I didn't mess it up .
Just let me catch you at it again .
I'm afraid I'll have to report you to the bos .
What do you mean .
You should know that I've been trying to improve myself .
But it's still far from enough .
Don't push me too far or you'll be sorry .
Get Out of Here .
You've got no right to speak to me like that .
Just don't let me see you again . That's all .
If you go on taking advantage of the lady I'll fix yo .
Just try and see .
If you don't behave yourself . You'll be sued .
Don't make a fuss over it .
Stay away from her she doesn't like you .
It's none of your business .
Clear off .
You'll have to pay for that .
I would accept the condition . If I were you , or he will let you go .
I'd rather give up the job than work for that hooliga .
Mark my words : I'll tell your boss . If you don't keep out of trouble .
Who cares .
I don't really want to say this but if you don't cooperate we shall have to cancel the contrac .
Neither side will benefit from it then .
We've got no other choice .
Are they always so noisy .
Sorry , Mr. Smith . I'm trying to make them quiet down .
I'm afraid if the noise goes on . I shall have no alternative but to leave .
I just taught him a lesson , nothing more .
I think you've carried it too far .
I'm sorry I slipped up there .
It Doesn't Matter , we're only discussing .
No one can be sure .
We should look at it from all angles .
I think that's Nonsense . That's beside the point .
I put forward the proposal after careful consideration .
It has a lot to do with the topi .
I think we should begin our tour with The Great Bell Temple . We can save a lot of time .
And the temple is very famous in China .
I'll take you up on tha .
Well let's gather there at 8 sharp . Okay .
Don't argu .
Let's sit down and talk things over .
I think a loan is a must to solve the proble .
But I think we can raise money by ourselves .
I think I'm at odds with you over the supply pla .
But it's already been approved by the boss .
Then I'll have to talk to him right awa .
I'm going to apply for the job .
But I don't think you stand much of a chance .
We'll see .
Pop music is really a bore .
I can't take your point completely .
Most young people enjoy it .
Simply because they're youn .
We can follow their lea .
That's all .
We must weigh the pros and cons before we make a decision .
It's really a hard-nut for us to crac .
Yeah , let's put our heads together and see if we can do something .
I suggest we ask the engineer for help first .
It's very important for us to clarify the ownershi .
I beg to differ with you on this matter , there won't be any problem with the ownership .
I think it's the price that should concern u .
I think production is the key to success of our company .
I'm afraid I have A Different Opinion I think management is the most important factor .
Wal-Mart is the most successful .
I think this point is made clear without debate .
I'm afraid I can't agree with you on THAT it's Microsoft that represents the trend of modern business .
I think we can solve those difficult situations first .
I'm afraid I can't accept your opinion , we should do it , step by step .
I'm not convinced by your explanation .
Which par .
The whole of it .
Could you explain it from beginning to end once again .
It would seem that you're right .
But can you prove it with facts .
Facts are not available yet , but I think we'll find them sooner or late .
The distribution plan is up to the boss himself . I think .
I take issue with you on that .
The company belongs to everyone . All of us have a say .
You look unhappy .
I love my girlfriend , but my parents disapprove of our marriage .
It's no use complaining .
You'd better it over with your parents again .
All right , I'll try it again .
Could you recommend a good restaurant .
Why not go to the White Rose .
That's my favorite plac .
Thank you . I'll take your advice .
What're you going to do next month .
I'll go to France and work as an interpreter for the compan .
Be sure to have your picture taken in front of the Eiffel Tower .
I'm not on good terms with my boss .
Don't be unhappy .
We need people in the marketing department The way I see it , you should join us .
Do you think I should join them .
If I were in your shoes . I certainly would .
But I'm afraid . It'll take up too much my time .
I've had a very good job offer John .
I want to accept i .
Okay . If you like , but I'd rather you didn't .
You have a good future here .
I've been working on the problem for a long time , but there's still no solutio .
Take it easy .
You might as well do something else NOW . Maybe you can find some clues later .
You look very pale .
I've got a bad headache .
I'd suggest you go to see the doctor at once .
Bob , why are you looking so depressed .
I made a mistake .
If I tell the boss . I'm afraid he won't forgive me , If I don't . Our company will suffer .
Would it be a good idea to tell him the truth .
John , you should take good care of yourself .
You're coughing these days you have to cut down on smoking , if you listen to me .
Do I need to carry out the plan no .
No you'd better not .
Could you offer me some advice .
I recommend that you wait until next month .
I haven't seen you for ages : What have you been doing .
I've been tied up with my business .
It's Sunday TODAY . Would you be interested in doing something outdoors .
It's a nice day and we're free this afternoon .
What do you think we should do .
How about going swimming .
Sounds like a good swim .
What do you make of the tax increase .
The state will benefit a lot . I think .
What do people think of it .
It's hard to say .
How do you find things over her .
It's quite different from what I expected .
Have you got used to the life .
English is not your , native tongue but you speak very good Englis .
How , in your opinion , can I improve my English .
First of all , you must be interested in it and then you should make constant efforts .
Don't you think that housework is very boring .
No . On the contrary , I consider it to be a nice change after work .
Maybe you're right .
What in your opinion , can be done to stop people smoking .
Stop producing cigarettes .
But that'll influence the national economy .
That's right , but I think it's the best wa .
How do you like this city .
Well , I must say it's pretty crowded .
And the traffic needs more control .
Do you have any particular views on sexual discrimination .
Nothing particula .
From my point of view women should have equal rights with men .
I'm happy that we hold the same view .
What would you say to some lunch .
So let's go .
What's your reaction to his comment .
It's unfair .
Nobody likes it .
I wonder where he's coming from .
I'd say you're very happy these days .
There's always a smile on your face . And you talk much more than before .
What's the reason .
It's just that I got my article published in the newspaper .
As I see it , Bob is not fit for the position .
I agree .
But remember , he's the cousin of our boss .
Yes , that is the reality .
I'm quite sure that he failed .
How did you find out .
He looked very disappointed when he read the notice .
Too bad he really worked hard .
I'd be glad to have your view on my report , Mr. Brow .
Well , I'm afraid . It's a bit longer than necessary .
Then I'll try to shorten It . Thank you .
From my point of view women should stay at home .
Your idea is completely out of date .
These days women have equal rights and equal opportunities .
What do you think of Jane's choice .
It's my feeling that she's made the right decisio .
But I think she should have thought it over .
She did and she decided to take the chance .
I'm convinced that his plan is feasible .
But the problem is that we don't seem to have the capital needed .
I think we'd better ask for a loan from the bank .
What's your opinion about boxing .
From where I stand . It is bruta .
But I think it's most enjoyable to watch .
Maybe to some people .
It's necessary for me to understand the organization of our company . First , isn't i .
Yes , I think so .
Let's start from the top executive .

The company consists of several interrelated departments they're relatively independent but each department has its own say .
Who is at the top .
The Board of Directors has the final say in all management matters .

David Burton .
Who is directly responsible to the Boar .
The general manager .
Actually , he's the most powerful except for the Board of Directors .
Is the general manager directly in charge of all the departments .
Each department has its manager .
Can I have a list of the names of all the managers .
I'm sure you'll get to know everybody soon .
The company is really well organized .
And it's very efficient .
Everybody knows his job and only deals directly with one or 2 people .
How many departments are there in the company .
There's 6 major departments personnel finance production marketing public relations and administratio .
Which one is the largest department .
The Production Department .
There're 500 people on the working staff in the department .
Where can I get my salary .
The Finance Department .
It's also in charge of Income tax if you're not clear about the taxes you should pay you can also go and ask them for help .
The public relations department is very important .
Yes , very important .
It helps to establish good relationships with other companies or institutions and to improve the image of the company .
Which department . Do you think is the most important .
Relatively speaking , the production department .
Without good products there will be no profit at all .

Hello , I'm calling from sportswear Unlimited .
We are interested in purchasing cash registers for our sales rooms .
We sell approximately 200 different items . So we would like registers that could be programed to keep sales records .
Actually we were looking for something smaller and a little less expensive than that model .
No , we wouldn't like to meet a salesman yet .
Could you send us brochures for each of those models you mentioned .
Later , after we have collected sufficient information we will contact you and request a demonstration .
Today , we paid 3,000 US dollars for our order number 98 into your account at the Bank of China .
We take pleasure in sending you a check of us in full settlement of your account .
We have arranged payment of your invoice number 245 for the arrivals kindly acknowledge receipt on entering the money to your credit .
We are pleased to enclose our check for 90,000 US dollars in settlement of your statement of account dated April 20 covering our orders for T-shirts in March .

We thank you for your letter enclosing a check in part payment of your account but would point out that the sum still outstanding is considerable .

We are surprised that you have taken no notice of our 2 previous applications for a settlement of our account of $3,000 , which is now much overdue our terms being 30 days from the date of invoice .
We regret that your failure to settle your account by October 7 has left us with no alternative but to demand payment by return of post or institute legal proceedings in the event of default .

They are concerned about the costs , which will eventually be passed on to Dafa garments .
That's what compensation trade is all about , and I'm fully aware of that .
The problem is that there is no other way out .
They suggest that we reduce the costs by buying second hand machines here in the US .
They like the new machines Can Do All the Tricks but would cost you a great deal less .
That sounds like a fabulous idea .
But do you really mean that the second hands are just as good as the new one .
Let me explain .
The labor costs here have become so high that the US garments industry has long lost the edge over their competitors from developing countries .
I can imagine tha .
To make the matter worse the orders received by the garments industry have gone down a great deal because of the recent recession .
A colleague of mine told me that quite a few garments makers in the LA area are considering closing down their factories because their machines have stayed idle already for months .
A couple of them are looking for prospective buyers of their machines .
I see what you mean .
But how old are those machines .
Some of them are old , but many others are quite new .
Good .
Thank you very much for the information and advic .
Now , what shall we do next .
Although I believe the second hands are just as good as the new ones . I think you should come to the States and take a look yourself we can inspect the machines together to make sure they satisfy your needs .
That's just what I was going to say .
I also suggest we negotiate the deal . Together with the factory owners because it is in our mutual interests to get the best possible machines at the lowest possible prices .
I couldn't agree more .
When do you think I should com .
As soon as I have 2 or 3 offers .
I think that'll take a week or so .
Then I'll call you again .

Mr. Ku I hope I can have an opportunity to discuss some of the insurance questions with you if you don't mind .
No , not a bi .
If you are free . Let us talk shop now .
It's very nice of you .
First about cargo insurance .
Cargo insurance is a major item of our busines .
We attach great importance to transportation insurance on China's imports and exports .
Insurance protection is available for different means of transportation such as marine land aviation as well as by post .
Insurance clauses are drawn up to cater for different kinds of commodities such as general cargo refrigerated cargo oil in bulk live animals and poultry and other goods .
I see .
Your insurance coverage is quite comprehensive .
How do you fix the premium rates .
The premium rates are fixed on the basis of the past statistical loss figure .
In principle , the rates vary with different interests insured and with different destinations and routes and carrying periods of insuranc .
What about the international insurance market .
Are your rates in line with it .
Oh yes , we always take into consideration the rate in the International market . This is an important factor which we can hardly ignore .
Do you handle open cover .
What I mean is if the insured party wished to make a long-term arrangement with the insurance company say for a year .
Of course we do .
That saves a large amount of labor and material and lessens the insured party's burden .
Right .
Besides the insured party gets more favorable rates .
Well , in case of loss or damage the insured party can receive payment locally in our city . I presume .
The People's Insurance Company of China at present maintains about 300 cargo surveying and claim settling agents in more than 90 countries and regions to conduct on the spot surveys .
There is one agent in YOUR city out of these agents . A very large number are authorized to effect settlement locall .
Tell me the procedure that a consignee should follow when damage to the goods occurs at destinatio .
The consignee should apply immediately for survey to the surveying agent or the claim settling agent .
In case , our company does not have a surveying agent or claim settling agent at the destination , a local competent surveyor may be applied to for survey .
I suppose , an ordinary surveyor won't d .
Of course he must be competent to perform the jo .
The consignee should obtain from the carrier or port authorities a certificate of loss or damage and or Shortland memo so that he can lodge a claim against the carrier or the party concerned as the case may be .
If the carrier were to make an excuse and disallow the claim , then the consignee would be at a loss for settlement .
Don't worry about that when you lodge a claim against the carrier . You may present the claim with the necessary documents to our company .
If after the examination of the case , we find the claim justifiable we shall make payment to the consignee and get the right of subrogation meanwhile we will take recourse against the party responsible , E g. the carrier .
Under such circumstances we are assured of payment of the claim and may leave the insurance company to deal with the carrier .
Yes , this is so only when the 3rd party liability is involved .
If the carrier is at fault . He will be held responsible for the loss or damage .
If it is due to the perils of sea or maritime accidents . The insurance company shall be liable to pa .
I suppose there are conditions under which the insurance company is NOT liable . Is that right .
Yes . If the loss or damage to the goods is caused by the intentional act or fault of the insured or arising from inherent vice or normal loss of the insured goods or delay in transit or falling under the liability of the consignor , the insurance company is not liable to pay .
In the last instance the buyer should file a claim against the seller .

Well , in case of loss or damage the insured party can receive payment locally in our city . I presume .
What's an economic risk .
Each minute of the day or night everyone faces a possible financial loss .
A home may be destroyed by fire damaged by lightning or leveled by a tornad .
Personal belongings may be stole .
A car may be damaged in an accident or it may cause injury to people and property .
Income may be lost as the result of the death , disability or unemployment of a family wage earner .
The chance that a loss of this kind , may occur is called an economic ris .
Can savings share economic ris .
Savings provide one way to take care of financial losse .
But savings are not the answer to large losses The best way to guard against large financial losses is through insurance .
I see .
Another thing I don't understand at this moment is the advantage of WPA coverage .
I thought that the WPA insurance should cover all principal risks whilst according to what you say . It means very little .
It seems to be a phrase without much substance .
Just what is the difference between WPA and FP .
This is a question , which is very often overlooked . Mr. Vichers .
It is a very common but mistaken idea that a merchant has done everything that is required to protect himself against losses when he has taken out WPA insuranc .
There is perhaps no mistake more detrimental to his interest .
That interests me very muc .
I must confess that I was under the impression that WPA insurance was quite sufficient and that losses due to breakage were covered .
I know that FPA insurance does not cover losses on consumer goods , but I did think that the WPA insurance covered more risks than the FPA .
Mr. Tao . I'd like to talk about the insurance covering the consignment with you .
Good . Please go ahead .
Are you going to have the consignment covered .
Yes .
We are going to insure the crockery with the PICC .
The PICC .
Oh , that is the abbreviation for the People's Insurance Company of Chin .
Can you give me a brief introduction of the compan .
Yes .
This company was founded in 1949 and is famous for its sound credit and reasonable rate .
It has over 300 surveyors and agents in the main ports in the world .
That sounds very interesting .
The company can cover the all basic risks such as FP A. WP A. all risks and other additional risks .
The coverage is quite extensive .
Here is the copy of the Ocean marine cargo clauses of PICC .
Please have a glance at it .
Thank you .
As to my shipment . I'd like to have them covered against WPA plus the risk of breakage .
These suit your consignment well .
I am afraid you have to pay the premium .
That's understood .
Can you give me some ideas of the premium charged by the PICC .
Sure .
The premium is calculated in this wa .
First find out the premium rate for the crockery that is 0.5% . Secondly , consider the risk covered What you have insured just now is WPA and the risk of breakage Finally calculate the total invoice value .
Our usual practice is to insure the parcel for 110% of the invoice valu .
Therefore , your premium should be about .
Can I insure the shipment for 130% invoice valu .
We can arrange for that as requested .
However , the extra premium is for your account .
I'll surely do that .
If you have no more question , please fill in this application for .
Okay .
Insured William seige .
Description of the shipment 100c s crockery marked GH in diamond .
Shipment by SS Helen scheduled to sail from Nanjing to Sydney on 8th March , 1996 .

Amount insured for 130% of the invoice value .
Is that all right . Mr. Tao .
Yes .
We'll have your consignment insured with the PICC against WPA and the risk of breakage for 130% invoice value .
Thank you very much for your hel .
You are welcome .
Good afternoon , Mr. Bai .
I was to come at 4 o'clock wasn't I .
Yes , Mr. Vichers .
We have been expecting you .
Mr. Vichers . This is Mr. KU of the People's Insurance Company of China .
He has come to explain the unfortunate affair about the insurance .
Thank you for comin .
Mr. Bai . As you may recall the February consignment arrived at Manila seriously damaged .
The loss through breakage was over 30% of the consignment .
We've presented a claim to the underwriters through your firm . But the insurance company refused to admit liability as there was no insurance on breakage we naturally were not satisfied with such a repl .
I should like to hear what Mr. KU has to say about it .
You know of course that we , the sellers are merely acting as mediators in this matter .
The insurance company is responsible for the claim as far as it is within the scope of coverage .
That's just the point Gentlemen , the loss in question was beyond the coverage granted by us .
According to your instructions , we made out an insurance certificate covering WPA and risk of breakage wasn't mentioned in it .
We phoned the ceramics section of the light industrial products Import & Export Corporation but were told that their customer had not asked for coverage in case of breakage .
In the letter of credit only coverage for all marine risks was requested .
I should like to point out that our prices were calculated without insurance for any special risk .
So we applied for the Usual WPA coverage and let our customers deal with the matter of breakage since the validity of the Letter of Credit was to expire in 2 days . There was no time to write for more detailed instruction .
If the letter of credit had been valid for a longer period . We should have had time to make the matter thoroughly clear .
Mr. Bai our import license only ran up to the middle of February . Consequently , we were not able to extend the validity of the Letter of Credi .
But we presume that the wording of our L C implies covering the risk of breakage .
Besides , when I take WP : A insurance that is with particular average I should think the risk of breakage is a particular average isn't it .
Not every breakage is a particular average .
It is a particular average when the breakage results from natural calamities or maritime accidents such as stranding and sinking of the carrying vessel or is attributable to fire explosion or collisio .
If none of these conditions occur breakage is often considered as an ordinary loss and represents what we call inherent vice or nature of the subject matter insured , which is outside the scope of the coverage .
But the risk of breakage is covered by marine insurance , isn't it .
Certainly , but it is the usual practice to make specific mention in the insurance policy or certificate that the risk of breakage is included .
The inclusion of this special risk will be subject to an additional premium which will normally be higher than the basic insurance for the ordinary marine risks .
The rate for such risk will vary according to the kind of commodity or as in ceramics , according to the fragility of the goods .
I think you must know all about that .
Well , I have heard something about it , but I can't say that it is very clear to me .
I must admit , I'm a layman as far as insurance is concerne .
Then , let me explain this insurance .
Mr. Vichers . Would you care for a cup of tea .
Or a cigarette .
No thank you . I don't smoke but a cup of tea . Would be nice .
And now let me hear more about the problem of insurance .
Do I understand that all marine risks means less than all risks .
The English understand by marine risks only risks incident to transport by sea such as collision stranding fire penetration of sea water into the holds of the ships , etc. in other words under all marine risks recoverable loss will only be confined to those arising from perils of the sea and maritime accidents Only The all risks coverage will admit all losses occurring at any time throughout the whole currency of the coverage . Irrespective of whether they are caused by accidents at sea or on LAND in this sense all marine risks provides a more limited cover than all risks .
I see .
Another thing I don't understand at this moment is the advantage of WP : A coverage .
I thought that WPA insurance should cover all principal risks while according to what you say . It means very little .
It seems to be a phrase without much substance .
Just what is the difference between WPA and FP .
This is a question , which is very often overlooked . Mr. Vichers .
It is very common but mistake idea that a merchant has done everything that is required to protect himself against losses when he has taken out WPA insurance .
There is perhaps no mistake more detrimental to his interest .
That interests me very muc .
I must confess that I was under the impression that WPA insurance was quite sufficient and that losses due to breakage were Covered . I know that FPA insurance does not cover losses on consumer goods , but I did think that the WPA insurance covered more risks than the FPA .
Actually it is like this .
There is some difference between WPA and FPA .
The FPA clause does not cover partial loss of the nature of particular average whereas the WPA clause covers such losses when they exceed a prearranged percentage .
This is the only difference between WPA and FPA .
Otherwise the protection under the FPA clause will be almost identical with that offered by the WPA clause , because in the event of maritime accidents encountered in transit such as stranding fire explosion or collision both clauses will cover particular average losses in ful .
I don't mean to annoy you Mr. KU , but I don't quite grasp this couldn't you say it in simpler terms .
I'll try .
Neither the WPA nor the FPA mentions the risks covered or the risks excluded .
The extent of insurance is stipulated in the basic policy form and in the various risk clauses .
Look at the insurance certificates and you will find that the risks of theft and pilferage freshwater oil grease hooks breakage leakage contamination deterioration etc. are specifically mentioned and must be specifically applied for these are special risks FPA stands for free from particular average .
Mr. Ku I must say that you have corrected my ideas about the insurance .
I see now that this is far more complicated than I ever imagined .
Now I know why you often point out to us , the wording of some letters of credit , which you don't feel happy about .
But what are we to do about it .
We must keep to the stipulations of the contract and the letter of credi .
The blame does not only rest with the Letter of Credit .
For an item like ceramics . I think the light Industrial Products Corporation should have understood from our letter of credit that we wanted to cover all the risks , including the risk of breakage , I must say the error was on both sides and I think the loss ought to be shared by both parties . Let us say , half and half .
Our price calculation could hardly admit that .
Besides we acted upon your instructions . So it is not our faul .
But in view of our good relationship we'll supply you with a favorable offer to compensate some of your losse .
I sincerely hope that you gentlemen will settle the matter to our mutual satisfaction .
It goes without saying that both parties must abide by the contract terms which we have agreed upon and signed .
This blunder which is due to my ignorance has cost me a pretty penny .
We also have learned a lesson from this .
Well to compensate a part of the loss as you suggested , may I ask you to make us a firm offer for 50,000 glazed wall tiles CIF Manila , including the risk of breakage November shipment .
We'll make you an offer tomorrow come and see us at 9:00 AM .
Thank you . Tomorrow at 9 then .
What should we do when our shipment has been totally lost or partially damaged .
We must prepare our claim and send it to the insurance company to secure payment .
Do brokers take care of that .
Yes , they usually do .
In Europe they charge a 1% commission on the amount of the claim for their collecting services while in the United States . They do the work without charge to the importer .
That's part of the service on the broker's side .
Exactly .
When we have bought insurance for the country of destination we can directly contact the insurance company or through our brokers .
What are the documents needed to obtain payment .
Well , let's talk about that next time .
Shall we talk about the mode of payment Mr. Zhao .
Yes for overseas deliveries we have to request payment by letter of credit .
That's customary for all foreign trade .
We usually accept a confirmed irrevocable L C payable against shipping document .
Oh , can you tell me what specific documents you will provide .
We are going to send you a full set of B L a commercial invoice an export license insurance policy a certificate of inspection a certificate of origin consular invoice and our sight draft on you .
I see . How about the validity of the L C .
The letter of credit is valid for 15 days after the shipment date .
Well I'll arrange with our bankers to open an irrevocable L C in your favor to cover the parcel .
Thank you very much . As soon as we receive your letter of credit . We'll immediately effect shipment by SS Evergreen sailing directly from Nanjing to Singapore . I am sure the arrival will prove to your entire satisfaction .
That's good . Since the sales season is approaching punctual delivery is the most important consideration in dealing with your Maker .
You may rest assured that we'll ship the lot on time to enable you to catch the brisk demand at the beginning of the season .
A good beginning is half DONE I am confident we can do more Business but I hope you can grant us easier terms for future transactions .
What do you suggest .
I hope you can draw on us on D A term .
You mean document against acceptanc .
I am sorry . We cannot accept such terms .
It is understood . I know you are worried about our credit .
To tell you the truth . Most of our regular suppliers are drawing on us at 30 days or 60 days on D A terms our reputation is very sound .
I believe that , but an irrevocable L C gives the seller , the extra protection of the banker's guarantee while under D P or D A system , there is no guarantee for paymen .
Yes . L C is very convenient to the seller , but is very expensive for us to establish it we have to pay a large sum of money in the bank as a deposit .
Well , we would probably allow you D P term as an exception in future if this initial business is satisfactory .
That's Excellent . I can see that you have adopted more flexible way in doing business than before . In my opinion flexibility plays a very important role in such a keen competitive commercial world .
I agree with You I hope easy terms of payment can result in more orders .
I am sure we'll place substantial orders with you in future .
You know your silk garments gain wide approval in Singapore .
That is very kind of you to say so .
I sincerely hope we can establish a long-term business relations and trust can be developed between our 2 companies through regular business .
I have the same wish I am sure at that time we can enjoy your favorable terms of payment .
I'm sorry to disturb you so late at night . I've been trying to reach you Mr. Edward .

In that case . I'll meet you in your office no .
I've got some unpleasant news for you today .
What is it .
You know the cargo to be shipped out this month .
Yes .
We are behind schedule , I'm afraid .
Behind for how lon .

I think we can manage that .
Thank goodness .
I'm relieved to hear that .

I'm doing great .
And you .

So you want to go to the meeting well prepared .
Right .

We'll do everything we can to carry it ou .
So will we .
Okay . Take care . And I hope to hear from you again soo .
You also take good car .

Thanks .
How was your intervie .
Tres bien I really appreciate your accompanying me here .
That's okay I happened to be fre .
Somy electronics .
Could you please tell me something about the English teacher position I saw advertised in this morning's China Time .
Let me transfer your call to the personnel section . One moment please .
Personnel section .
Hello . I'm interested in the English teacher position you advertised in today's China Times .
Certainly Can you tell me your name and how much teaching experience you have .
My name's Michael Jones and I have a degree in linguistics from Central State university I've taught English for 5 years .
That's the sort of experience . We're looking for .
Can you come in for . In an interview . Sometime today .
Sure would 3 o'clock be okay .
That would be fine .
And would you please bring 2 copies of your resume and one copy of your college diploma we'll expect you at 3 Mr. Jones .
How did you find that last lot of marmalad .
Oh . Excellent .
But one or 2 buyers said the marmalade might be a little too swee .
I see .
And the canned peaches what about them .
That's a different story .
The taste of The Peaches is FINE . But as you know appearance counts in canned foods .
Without any doubt appearance comes before pric .
How could the canned peaches be improved .
I recommend a pleasant color and no mess .
Where's the mess . Exactly .
In the syrup or in the peach halves .
Customers have told me that hollow of the peach halves . You know the inside of the peach should be clean cut that is to say no fibers or pulp remaining .
Aren't they supplied that way now .
No many consignments are not .
Are these goods needed urgently .
Not urgentl .
We want to be able to release them in our market , say , 3 months from now .
Then I'll have a talk with one or 2 of our Makers they'll be in to see me sometime this week .
What else have you got outstanding besides these piece goods .
The made up goods for Europe and the rayon scarves for Southeast Asia .
Well , the last lot of scarves after we took the delivery . We heard of a competitor . Getting similar scarves from the same maker only at $30 per doze .
Really .
We'll look into THAT might have been a question of quantity again .
Anyway . We'll see what the makers have to say about this .
Well , that's about all for the present .
We may have some more business for you before Long . Let's hear from you about market conditions from time to time .
Certainly , I'll let you know what's going on .
You've been a little behind schedule in sending us your supplies lately we've notice .
Yes , we have in one or 2 consignments . I'm sorry to say .
Shipping line schedules haven't fitted in very well .
We were 3 weeks late in getting our goods to the distributors .
How about sending 2 consignments a month , making them approximately half the value of the present monthly shipment . We are sending you now .
No , I don't think there's any need to change the monthly arrangement .
It is easier for us to keep to the present monthly system of cours .
Yes , you'd better stick to the present .
What is it 70 cases a mont .
The number of cases varies we're restricted by your letter of credit .
That sets the limit of $30,000 per MONTH . It works out at about 60 to 70 crates a month .
I thought we established 2 credits .
Can't you use the other in case of need .
No that credit is reserved for shipments that we make to your branches .
Oh , of course , I remember .
You're getting orders directly from the branches with financing done by our head offic .
That's right .
What are you sending to our branches nowadays .
Much the same class of goods that we send to you .
Fewer electrical heating appliances plenty of transistor radio set .
Well for their markets down south . There's a smaller demand naturally for heating equipment .
Incidentally we could take more of your portable radio sets and tape recorders .
That's good .
What quantities have you in mind .
Say , 5,000 transistor radios monthly and thousand tape recorders .
I'll get offers from 2 or 3 of the best makers here .
When do you want their quotations .
If possible . I will be here for about a WEEK then I will go over to Hong Kong , possibly to Thailand and Singapore .
Do you think I could have the offers before I leave for Hong Kong .
Certainly you can .
I'll have them ready by tomorrow evening .
Good .
I'll cable the offers and get the head office to start looking for additional outlet .
There's a demand , I'm sur .
Thank you .
It is very nice of you to invite me to have Chinese food .
It's my pleasure .
You now Mr. Davis there is typical Chinese style cuisine in this hotel .
I like Chinese food very much .
Mr. Davis , can you tell me what impresses most when you visited our showroom just now .
Well your newly designed racing bikes are very smart .
Yes . They are the new models of Golden Lion brand but are a lot lighter than other models .
They look colorful to .
Yes .
This new model is very popular in our domestic market , especially the young people like the style . Very muc .
You are right . Young people always appeal to novel beautiful gadgets .
Mr. Jing , would you like to tell me how much they weigh .
Those made of all steel weigh around 17 kilos those of light aluminum alloy about 15 kilos onl .
It is very impressive .
What is your model range .
Generally speaking , we have bikes for gents and ladies size 1921 25-27 . The color and designs vary .
Do you think our products will find market in your area .
There is a possibility of course .
However , our young buyers are rather choosy what they like is the sound quality and famous brand .
Besides reliability is very important , too .
Sure .
Quality includes reliability , which is our strong point .
In fact our multiple speed racing bicycles are concentrating the essence of our technical know-how .
On top of that Jingshi brand is well known in the international market .
Our bikes have been exported to many countries such as America western European countries and Japan etc .
Our end users are satisfied with our products .
I believe so .
But your products are very new to our customers .
They must be handled very carefully . From the beginning .
You know it is not easy to push the sale of a new product .
Surely you are right here .
But we can say that good quality and a reasonable price , combined with your corporation will make our bicycles competitive in your market .
I hope so .
At the initial stage of the promotion advertising is very important .
But you know , advertising expense must be expensive .
Well , we'll send you some of our brochures catalogs free of charge .
Thank you very much .
Now Mr. Jing , I'd like to know what your service charges will be .
You mean commission That's what I was going to talk to you about .
The remuneration increases with the turnover .
I'd like to have the idea of the percentage .
The usual commission we allow our agent is 5% based on the sales turnover .
I see .
But Mr. Jing , I think at the very beginning . The 5% commission is a little low .
You know , at the beginning of our sales campaign , traveling and advertising expenses must be very high .
A smooth first deal always helps the future sales .
How about 6% commission Mr. Davi .
Let's call it a dea .
I can assure you that the minimum annual turnover will reach 10,000 sets for your novel bicycle .
Good .
I hope we can do a lot of business together in the future .
I am sure we ca .
Ganbei .
Ganbei .
How are you . Mr. Chen .
How are you . Mr. Smith .
Would it be all right for me to have look at your sample room .
Sure .
This way , please .
Thank you .
Where , shall we start .
I'm afraid it would take hours if I really look at everything .
You're right , let's first look at those items you're interested in . Oka .
Good idea .
I can just have a glance at the res .
By the way , how long have you been in this business .
I've been in the line of electrical appliances for more than 20 years .
No wonder you're well experienced .
Electrical appliance business has become more and more difficult to do since the competition grew more and more fierc .
That's true .
Do you have a catalog or something that tells about your company .
Yes .
I'll get you some late .
How many copies . Would you like to have .
10 pleas .
I'd like to airmail some back home .
Alright . This is a good idea .
We could consider some arrangements to buy from you if your price is competitive and the trade terms are favorable .
That's grea .
I'm afraid I've taken a lot of your time toda .
It Doesn't Matter . I'm very glad to have been of help .
What do you have in mind for this afternoo .
I have some paperwork to finish .
So both of you will stay in the hote .
Okay . As for this evening we'll hold a dinner in your honor at Sichuan restauran .
That's very kind of yo .
Mr. Li our manager will host the dinner and some other important people will also be there .
I'll be delighted to meet them .
Is 6 o'clock a convenient hour for you .
Yes .
In fact , any time will do .
Very good .
I'll come for you at 6 o'clock this evening .
This dinner will start at 6:30 .
Well at 9 o'clock tomorrow morning you'll take a tour up on the Tiananmen Gat .
A tour on the Tiananmen Gate .
Mr. Yang , you must be kidding .
I'm no .
The gate was just open to the public .
Absolutely fantasti .
That's the gate on which the late Chairman Mao proclaimed the founding of the People's Republic of China .
A tour on that gate is quite an experience even for us , Chinese .
Dear Mr. Bowen Mr. Dewey and my dear colleague .
We're very happy to have Mr. Bowen and Mr. Dewey here with us tonight .
Confucius once said . What a joy , it is to have friends coming from afar .
Mr. Bowen is an old friend of ours .
He and Mr. Dewey come from the other side of the earth so our joy tonight is beyond expression .
Mr. Bowen is a pioneer in the US trade with China .
He was among the first American businessmen who came to China right after the ping-pong diplomacy in the mid seventy's .
Since then we've signed 17 contracts with Wilshire fashion .
Though there have been ups and downs in the trade volume . We've developed a mutually beneficial and therefore very solid relationship .
And we're very proud of this .
As our present contract is expiring next month . We're very pleased to have you here to work with us on a new contract .
I firmly believe that through our mutual efforts . The new contract will further strengthen the ties between our 2 companies and make both of us more prosperou .
Our negotiation will begin the day after tomorrow .
I'd like to take this opportunity to propose a toast to the success of the negotiation and to the prosperity of our 2 companies .
Bottoms Up .
Oh I'm starving .
Where shall we have lunch , gentlemen .
Any place will do .
A full lunch or just a snack .
As we'll have 2 more factories to visit . I suggest we have a light lunch .
Too full a stomach will make me drowsy .
What do you say Mr. Yang .
Whatever my boss says .
All right , we'll pull in at the Nancy's Dine .
Here we are .
I'd like to have a big slice of pizza and a blueberry ice cream .
A jumbo hot dog a submarine sandwich and a sundae for me .
I'll have a fish burger and an order of French fries .
Waitress What kind of drinks . Do you like .
A Coke for me .
A 7 up .
A Sprite , please .
It's a miracle that you own such a factory .
You've been here for only 2 years you sai .
Yes .
I've borrowed money from my relatives .
I guess it must be quite an experience running a business here in the US .
You can say that again .
How is your business .
So far so goo .
Then why do you want to sell your machines .
A good question .
To be frank with you the profits . I've made from this business are not as big as I Expected , so I want to sell the machines , possibly the whole business , so that I can invest elsewhere .
Well , could you show us your machines and their specifications .
Sure come over here .
This is a computer aided designing system .
Let me turn it on .
Good you can design new clothes and alter old ones on screen using this mouse .
You can also do scaling rotating rearranging and all kinds of other tricks on it .
Once you are happy with the design just click this button and the design will be automatically printed out to make the patterns .
Can it do grading as well .
Of course it can .
Just type in the new parameters and press this button , tell me which size , do you want .
Size 10 .
No problem .
Size 10 , here you are .
Thank yo .
What's this .
A computerized embroidering machin .
Again , you can make the design on the computer .
The Machine has 12 heads so once you've completed your design it can embroider 12 identical patterns at the same time .
It's such a time-save .
You can have them at 85% of the invoice value .
As you can see these are all hi-tech machines and they are all as good as new .
Moreover , the prices of similar machines have gone up recently .
Really .
Take this one for example I bought it at $17,500 and the latest price is $19,000 .
So I wouldn't , sell it , even at the original price if I did not want to use the money to invest elsewhere .
I'm afraid I can get the same machine in China . Even at $17,000 it will be brand new and need no shipping expenses .
No kiddin .
Well the price must have changed again .
So if you are really interested in selling your machines at a realistic price it should not exceed 3 fifths of the original price as most of your machines were bought one or 2 years ago .
I'm afraid that's bit too low .
Well , as we have one more factory to visit , please think about Mr. Li's bid Mr. we'll come back if you are interested .
Hi , Mr. Bowen .
Glad to see you again here .
Hi . Mr. Li and Mr. Yang .
I didn't know you were also coming .
We were invited to the party at the last minute .
I see anyway . It's great to be together again .
It seems we'll be partners foreve .
All righ .
Here's to my lifelong partne .
Well , now that the mission's been completed , you might be eager to find new business opportunities .
Right on .
Look , have you met the man over there .
The one in the dark blue suit .
With a striped tie .
N .
He's David Taylor a brewer with wide connections in the business . Circl .
Perhaps he can give you some hints about new business opportunities .
Could you introduce me to him .

These commodities are handled by the China Arts and Crafts Import and Export Corporation the items you mentioned are handled separately by their Beijing , Shanghai and Tianjin branches .
Do you think it is possible for me to meet them all during my Visit I plan to stay here for 5 days .
Yes , I think so . I'll tell the trade delegations of your arrival and arrange the time for you to meet each of them separatel .

This is Mr. Dewey Mr. Bowen's assistant .
Thank you very much . Mr. Li a great pleasure to meet you all .
Now that everybody knows everybody else shall we sit down and talk .
Dear Mr. Li friends and colleagues .
Thank you very much . Mr. Li for all the good things you said about me and Wilshire fashion .
Doing business with Dafa garments is one of the most enjoyable experiences in my life .
20 years ago I was told that the most trustworthy people in the world are Chinese .
So I came to CHINA . Now I find you are not only trustworthy but also full of new ideas .
You are willing to explore every possibility for new business .
So I already regret that during this visit . We have only one new contract to work on .
Why not 10 a hundred .
I'm seriou .
Well , joking aside , I'm really excited at the new opportunities your economic reform has offered us .
Like you , we'll explore every new possibility to expand our relationship and contribute more to your modernization .
Now , may I propose a toast .
Here's to the success of our negotiation to the continuation of our friendship and to the success of your great reform . Cheers .
Where is your compan .
It's located near the railway station on KUNA Chien Roa .
What type of company , is it .
It's a trading compan .
Does most of your business deal in exports .
Yes , most of our business is in trade with America .
How about Japan and Europe .
Well at the moment . Not much , but with a view to future trade . We have branch offices in New York and Chicag .
We're planning to open a new office in Hong Kong , too .
Is your main office in Taipei .
Yes it was founded in 1975 .
I belong to the export department and I meet foreign customers I show them our new products and discuss trade terms with them .
I sometimes entertain our customers .
I'd like you to see the articles . We have on display at our office you will find it a worthwhile visit , I believe .
I'm sure I will .
When could you spare the time for a visit . Do you thin .
Oh , let's see .
Say Tuesday or Wednesday morning of next week .
Good .
I'll take you along .
What time shall we make it .
10 o'clock Tuesday Morning How's that with you .
Suits me fine . I'll be waiting for you at 10 on Tuesday of next week .
This is our showroom .
I say .
You've got some nice things here .
Do you get many overseas buyers here .
Yes , quite a few .
They like to keep up to dat .
You see , we change the display pieces every month .
Do you really .
This is a quaint set .
What is it .
A coffee set .
That's a porcelain coffee set maybe a little austere for foreign taste .
I'm afraid it is .
What would you say is the trend just now in mood or tastes for tableware .
Tea and coffee sets particularly .
I'd say there is gentle move away from the simple to the baroque .
Is that an indication that people have had enough of simple designs .
No , not at all .
The simple will remain odd shapes or unusual shapes usually last for a couple of years or so , then give way to something els .
That's good for business . Surel .
It is this set here for instance is popular just now .
It looks nice , don't you think so .
Very nice a dessert set shallow cups Oval plate and saucer .
I think I prefer the round plate and saucer thoug .
Beautiful colors , shapes and blending can be worked in glass nowadays .
I agree .
Glass always takes a nice polish and looks nice under the light .
Here we are .
Mainly glass ware . In this section .
That's the Line Flower fruit and dish sets .
I'm sure we could work up a good business in that line and in those vases over there .
Well take a supply of these leaflets .
Just a second , I'll get a set of illustrations for you .
Do please .
I'll take some back with me to show to our distributors .
Fine . Thank you .
Now you can go back to your rooms and take a short rest .
Please come downstairs at 4:30 PM and our coach will be awaiting you in front of the hotel Hall .
Now my watch is 5 to 4 .

Please set your watches by my watch .
Where . Shall we go .
Shall we go swimming as planned in the tour itinerary .
Yes .
We shall go to the famous large seashore swimming pool and have a splendid dusk .
That's grea .
Our coach will possibly arrive at the seashore swimming pool at 5:00 P .
We shall spend 1.5 hour at that beautiful seashore .
Those who love swimming can have a good fun today .
Those who don't want to swim can sit at the seashore and enjoy Yourselves You can watch the splendid sunset .
Shall we have supper there .
No today , I will bring you to a special place where you can enjoy all the famous seafood .
Marvelous .

What's that long building .
That's the recreation center and restaurant .
Would you mind showing me your showroo .
Of COURSE it's on the 5th floor .
Are all these goods made in your factory .
Yes , most of them are except for the plastic part .

My name is David Sung I'm the manager of the Taiwan Trading Company .
I'm very pleased to meet you Mr. Sung .
I have a letter of introduction from the president of my company . It was very nice of you to come and meet me .
It's nothing at all . Mr. Pau .
I take it that you had no trouble going through customs .
None whatsoever . I'm happy to SAY the customs officers were all very kind and efficien .
That's good .
And how was your flight across the Pacific .
It was perfectly delightful thanks to your country's flag carrier the China Airlines .
Oh you came by Cal .
Yes , and I'm glad I did , because the service was A  .
The stewardesses were so kind and charming that I was almost tempted to propose marriage to every one of the .
And if they had all accepted you would have become a bigamist .
But joking aside , I'm glad to hear you liked Cal .
I certainly did .
And now I have a car waiting outside to take you to your hotel right this way please .
Thank yo .
Are both these bags your .
Yes .
Do you have any other luggage .
No just these 2 bags .
I believe in traveling as light as I possibly can .
That's very wise .
Let me carry them for you .

Gentlemen , on behalf of our company . I'd like to welcome you to Taiwan .
My name is . Jill Lee .
Nice to meet you . Miss Lee I'm Leo Burns .
This is Bob . O'Connor and this is Gordon Weaver .
I'm happy to meet you all , please call me Jill .
I'd like to take a few moments to tell you about your schedule HERE today through Friday , you'll be pretty tied up at the factory .
How far is the factory and how are we getting there .
A car will pick you up at 8:00 AM and it's about a 45-minute drive to the factory .
Lunch is from 12 to 1 and you'll be back at your hotel by 6 .
So we'll be back in time to check out the nightlife .
Yes . And when you do here's some useful information .
Good .
This is our first time Here we don't know the City at all .
Here are a map of the city . A list of restaurants and clubs and a list of common expressions in Mandarin Chinese .
Thanks .
Will it be difficult for us to get around since we can't speak Chinese .
Not really . Many people can speak a little English but to play it safe , you should keep the name of your hotel written in Chinese for the taxi drivers .
How about tipping .
How much is Common .
Actually you aren't expected to tip in most places except in international hotels .
What are some good places for shopping .
Taipei has many night markets and bazaars for inexpensive gifts .
One thing you should remember is you are expected to bargain by writing down your offer and having the shop owner write down his .
Should we use cash .
Yes because most places only accept NT dollars .
We're really looking forward to seeing some of the cit .
I'm sure you'll enjoy yourselve .
If there's anything I can do to help . Please let me know .
Good morning .
My name is Smith . I'm from California , USA . Here is my business card .
Pleased to meet you Mr. Smith .
My name is . Li Ping .
Pleased to meet you too . Mr. L .
Take a seat , please .
Thank yo .
May I offer you a cup of tea .
Yes , thank you .
I like your Longjing tea very much .
Well , from your business card . I can see that you specialize in oil drilling equipment .
Yes , as a matter of fact , we have been in this business for more than 30 year .
By the way , Mr. Wang from your commercial office in Washington has referred me to you in the hope that I might be of some help in oil industry .
Currently , we have a strong interest in opening up more new oil fields and therefore could consider some arrangements to buy from you only if the technology incorporated in your equipment is advanced and the trade terms are favorable .
I have brought with me a series of catalogs for our latest models .
I have my engineer accompanying me on the trip .
He will be glad to meet your technicians and answer any technical questions about our products .
That's a splendid idea .
We shall . First of all study your catalogs and get in touch with the end users .

Very goo .
I'm staying in beijing Hotel . My room number is 40 .

Hello Mr. Hammer .
Jack Ross here .
I'm calling to confirm our appointment on Monday at 10 o'clock in your office .
Yes . Everything's all se .
I'd like to bring Mr. Huang and Ms Sun with me .
We're supposed to be meeting alone .
I know , but I think they may add something valuable to the discussion .
Fine , but no one else . Okay .
Yes Mr. Hammer .
I'm sorry but I have to change the day of my appointment . I wonder if I could change it to friday .
No problem . Mr. Kennedy .
Thank yo .
Good morning , Mr. Smith .
Good morning , Mr. Chen .
We're meeting again .
I suppose you've decided to accept our offer of the day before yesterday .
You know , Mr. Chen , although I myself feel your quotation is acceptable . I still can't accept it now as the authority given to me is limited .
I called my home office up immediately after our talk the day before yesterday , and told them of our talk and your quotation . And I also suggested that they accept it .
Did they agree to your proposal .
I just received their reply this morning and they accepted the proposal in principle .
Good .
I'd say Mr. Smith you've done your share in pushing the initiative when you reported to your home office .
Mr. Chen I'm extremely anxious to do my part in pushing the development of trade between our 2 firm .
We appreciate your efforts , very much .
Shall we prepare the contract at once along the lines of our last tal .
Yes . But as to the arbitration terms my home office thinks that it's better to summit our arbitration case to an organization in a 3rd country if any disputes aris .
I do not mean that the Foreign Trade arbitration commission of the China Council of the Promotion of International Trade is not reliable nor do I mean that any disputes should be referred to arbitratio .
It is not necessary to submit a case to arbitration . As long as our 2 parties can discuss the matter in a friendly manner .
But Mr. Chen . Business is business . And isn't it better to make the stipulations complete before we sign the contract .
Has your Home Office cabled acceptance of all the other terms .
Yes , all the other terms are accepted , provided that you agree arbitration be held in a 3rd country in Sweden , for instance .
Oh I see .
Alright . We will take this transaction as an exception and accept your request to hold arbitration in Sweden .
Very good . Mr. Chen .
The transaction is now concluded and our talk has been a success .
Yes . Congratulations to you .
The same to you .
When shall I come to sign the contract .
What about tomorrow morning at 10 .
Fine , it's perfectly alright for m .
How do you do . Mr. Zhang .
How do you do . Mr. Johnson .
Since it's the first time I'm doing business with you . I'm afraid I'm not quite clear on the arbitration clause .
Is there anything particular you want to know .
Mr. Zhang , would you please explain it in general .
Okay .
Generally speaking , we would like to resolve all disputes amicably by negotiations .
What if amicable negotiations fail .
Then the case may be submitted for arbitration .
Mr. Zhang , if there is a dispute between a Chinese company and a foreign company and it goes to arbitration . In what country . Will the arbitration be held .
Will it be in the country of the claimant .
Or in the country of the defendant .
It really depends on what the parties have agreed between themselves and stipulate in their arbitration agreemen .
Do you permit arbitration in a 3rd country .
Yes we do .
Traditionally , our contracts did not contain provision for arbitration in a 3rd country .
It is only in recent years that our contract clauses permit arbitration in the 3rd countries .
The 3rd countries includ .
Switzerland and Sweden are most common but Canada , Singapore and others have also been include .
What procedural rules will apply if arbitration is to take place in China .
The CIETAC procedural rules will apply .
What about the applicable substantive law .
Will it be the Chinese law .
Not necessarily .
In the case of a sales contract . The parties are free to choose the applicable laws and specify it in their contract .
So far as contracts involving foreign investment in China are concerned the Chinese substantive law will apply .
Is the arbitral award final and binding upon the parties .
Yes it IS and an award , made in China is enforceable in another country .
And what about the cost of arbitration in Chin .
Is it very high .
No . On the contrary , it is pretty low .
Well this talk is most informative .
Anyway I still prefer to settle disputes by amicable conciliation between the 2 parties .
I think so to .
Especially when you've established a long-term good business relationship with us . It is usually much easier to handle the disputes through amicable negotiations .
That's tru .
We thank you for your time .
It's my pleasure .
Good morning . Mr. Chirac .
Good morning . Mr. Hong .
Very glad to see you agai .
Mr. Chirac the medical equipments we discussed yesterday are quite valuable .
Yes the equipments are of high quality and VERY useful . So they're certainly valuable .
The design of the equipments is sophisticated and therefore the inspection is no easy job .
When I think of the inspection . I am worried that there might be some disputes over the results of inspection .
You needn't worry about that .
There is an arbitration clause in the contract isn't there .
Shall we discuss the arbitration clause no .
All right .
We always attach importance to the arbitration clause of a contrac .
Okay .
As the Chinese saying goes to get prepared against a rainy day we had better think more of the possible problems which might happen afterward .
You are right .
In case of any dispute , we should try to out our differences through amicable negotiations .
If we fail to reach a settlement . We will then submit the case in dispute for arbitration to an international arbitration organizatio .
Where do you think the arbitration will be held .
Would it be agreeable to you to adopt the customary practice that has been used in the Sino-France-trade .
I don't know the customary practice in Sino France trade regarding the place for arbitration .
Will you enlighten me in this regar .
It is in the country of the defendant .
That is to say , If we submit the case for arbitration , the place for arbitration is in France . And if you submit the case for arbitration , the place for arbitration is in China .
That's okay .
The International Commercial Arbitration Association of France is well known for its impartiality .
They are professionally competent and in a position to arbitrate that kind of problems arising from the quality inspection of the medical equipment .
But I am wondering if arbitration is to take place in China what procedural rules will apply .
The CIETAC procedural rules will apply .
CIETAC stands for China International Economic and Trade Arbitration Commission .
Oh I see . Then what about the applicable substantive law .
Generally speaking , the parties to a sales contract are free to choose the applicable law and specify it in their contract . But so far as the contracts involving foreign investment in China are concerned the Chinese substantive law will apply .
Is that so .
Well , when arbitration is to take place in France . I suppose we can submit it to a standing French arbitration commission is it all right with you .
I'm sorry , Mr. Chirac we don't agree with you to submit it to a standing arbitration organization in france It's better to submit the case to a temporary arbitration tribunal .
In that case , arbitrators are to be nominated by BOTH Parties . The arbitrators will then form a temporary arbitration tribunal soon after the case is settled . The tribunal is dissolved .
It is a bit annoying . I thin .
For a big sum of money involved , we shouldn't feel annoyed by this trouble .
I think such a tribunal consisting of arbitrations from both sides will be fair and able to handle any dispute without bias or partiality .
How about the appointment of arbitrators if arbitration is to take place in China .
According to the Chinese rules for arbitration one or 3 arbitrators can be appointed . We may hold consultation to appoint a sole arbitrator in case 3 arbitrators are to be appointed each party may nominate one arbitrator from the CIETAC panel of arbitrations .
Then the 3rd one is to be appointed by the Chairman of CIETAC as the Presiding arbitrator .
The 3 arbitrators so appointed will form an arbitration tribunal to hear the case .
If so which party will pay the arbitration fe .
Well , generally speaking , all the fees for arbitration shall be borne by the losing party unless otherwise awarded by the tribunal .
And how is the arbitral award made .
By the decision of the majority of the arbitrators .
And the arbitral award is final and binding on the parties isn't it .
Yes it is .
I have another question .
Is an arbitral award made in China enforceable in another country .
Yes .
China is a signatory to the 1958 New York Convention .
Well , personally I should say it's so much better to resolve the dispute through friendly negotiations between the 2 parties .
I agree with you .
Arbitration is only the last resort .
Now , let us go over the stipulations of the arbitration clause of the contract .
That's right .
I agre .
When can I have your firm CIF prices that is the final and firm offer Mr. Zhang .
We'll have them worked out by this evening and let you have them tomorrow Morning would you be free to come round then .
Good . I'll be here tomorrow morning at 10 . How is that .
Perfectly our offers remain open for 3 days .
I don't need that long to make up my mind .
If your prices are favorable and if I can get the commission I want I will place the order right away .
I'm sure you'll find our price most favorable Elsewhere prices for hardware have gone up tremendously in recent years .
Our prices haven't changed much .
I'm glad to hear that .
We'll be happy to .
Is there anything else I can do for you , Mr. Clive .
I'm buying for chain department stores in Canada .
They are interested in Chinese carpets , I'd like to make an inquiry .
Could you introduce me to the person in charge of this lin .
Certainly I'll make an appointment for you with Mr. Li of the China National Native Produce and Animal by products Import and Export Corporation .
Thank you very much .
This is our rock bottom price Mr. Li we can't make any further concession .
If that's the case , there's not much point in further Discussion we might as well call the whole deal of .
What I mean is that we'll never be able to come down to your price . The gap is too grea .
I think it unwise for either of us to insist on his own price .
How about meeting each other half way and each makes a further concession . So that business can be concluded .
What is your proposal .
Your unit price is $100 higher than we can Accept when I suggested we meet each other half way I meant it literall .
Do you mean to suggest that we have to make a further reduction of $50 in our price .
That's impossible .
What would you suggest .
The best we can do , will be a reduction of another $30 that'll definitely be rock bottom .
That still leaves a gap of $20 to be covered .
Let's meet each other half way once more then the gap will be closed and our business completed .
You certainly have a way of talking me into it .
All right , let's meet half way agai .
I'm glad we've come to an agreement on price .
We'll go on to the other terms and conditions at our next meeting .
Yes , there's one other point I wish to clear up .
What is it .
My friends in business circles all seem to be of the opinion that the Chinese import and export corporations have become more flexible in doing business recently .
Yes . They're right .
In fact we have either restored or adopted international practices in our foreign trade .
I'm glad to hear THAT with a view to expanding and further enhancing the bilateral relations between our 2 parties and in particular exchanging timely views on specific problems in the execution and enforcement of contracts . Is it possible for us to have a representative that could stay permanently in Beijing .
Basically speaking . Yes . We welcome the establishment of representative offices of foreign companies in beijing Of course there are more details to attend to . We cannot settle it in a few words .
Yes of course .
I'll call my home office tonight and let them know about IT : When do we meet again .
How about tomorrow morning at 9 .
Good . I'll come back tomorrow and we can then discuss it more specifically .
We are very pleased to welcome you to the Guangzhou fair .
I'm also very happy to have the chance to visit your trading delegation Mr. Zhang .
As you know , this is the first time I have been to China .
I'm sure I'll have a pleasant stay here and do some business with you .
I share the same wish I think you have had a look at the exhibits in the house and wonder whether you could let me know the specific products you are interested in .
Oh it's forever brand bicycles .
Our firm has been importing your bicycles for the past 5 years .
As a friend of China . I'm happy to tell you that your forever bicycles are most popular with our customers and it has become one of the best-selling brands on our market .
I'm here with a pile of orders . I'd like to have your lowest quotations CIF Dar es Salaam .
I'm very glad to have your inquiry .
If you tell me the quantity you want . We will make a quotation .
Well we've studied your catalogs and also the price of similar bicycles in the world market .
Comparatively speaking your price as quoted last month is 10% higher than that from Holland and 7% higher than that from Japan .
I presume you're aware of the situation .
However , with an eye to future business , our customers in Zambia still intend to make a big deal with you if your price should be more competitive .
On our part . We appreciate the longstanding cooperation between us .
Here is our latest price list and all the prices listed here are subject to our final confirmation .
Please go over it first .
Can I have a 7% commission . If I place an order for 5,000 bicycles .
We usually do not allow any commission but in consideration of your big order we can grant you a 3% commission .
Very good .
A commission on your prices would make it easier for us to promote sale .
While we well understand the position a middleman is in . We would like to point out , frankly , that a 3% commission is really an exception .
Very goo .
Good morning , Mr. Brown . I understand you want to discuss the price of Walnut meat with us .
That's right .
We've made the offer ready for you . Oh , here it IS : The offer is firm for 5 days , $400 per metric ton CIF Sydney shipment at the end of March , 1993 .
Why your price has gone up .
It's almost 10% higher than last year's .
It would be impossible for us to make any sales at such a pric .
But you certainly know the price of Walnut meat has risen greatly in the last few MONTHS our price is still much lower than what you can get elsewhere .
You should give it an overall consideration and ours is of High Quality Walnut meat from other sources cannot compare with i .
I grant that yours are of better Quality . But still , we don't think we can succeed in getting our customers to buy at such a high price . Besides there's keen competition from suppliers in Thailan .
You can't very well ignore that .
So how about reducing the price by 5% .
Our offer is made on the basis of many factors , including the rising trend of the world market .
If I were you I would not worry about that at all .
Taking everything into consideration . I can assure you that the price we offered to you is VERY favorable . I don't think you will have any difficulty in pushing sales .
To be frank with you we would not be willing to make you a firm offer at that price . If it were not for the longstanding relations between u .
But the market prices are changing frequently How can I be sure that the market will not fall before the arrival of goods at our port .
It's up to you to make a decision .
If you can promise delivery before February , I'll be able to decide .
It looks as if the market won't go down until then .
The earliest delivery we can effect is in March . But we can assure you that we'll do our best to advance the shipment .
All right .
May I ask if you allow any commission .
From European suppliers . I usually get a 5% commission on my imports .
It's the general practic .
We don't want to bargain we usually allow a 3% commission .
Well , if that's the case I suppose I'll have to do the same won't I .
Welcome to Beijing Mr. Griffin .
Thank you . I'm glad I was able to come .
Did you have a pleasant trip .
Not reall .
We ran into a thunderstorm over Hong Kong and the airplane was so tossed about that everyone got airsick .
Is that so .
I'm sorry to hear that .
I hope you had a good rest after tha .
I had a very restful night .
Xinqiao hotel is a nice quiet place .
I'm quite myself again .
Shall we take up the tallow business now .
That's fine with me .
I'm read .
In your reply to our inquiry you clearly stated the reasons why you couldn't make us an offer at the time and suggested a personal talk about this .
Will it be possible for you to resume negotiating the deal no .
Please accept my apologies for our inability to be more responsive to your inquiry .
That's all right unforeseen circumstances do occur , don't the .
They do you see when we received your inquiry the world market was suffering from a currency crisis which made it difficult for us to make a firm offer .
Now that is more or less over at least for the time being .
I presume you know where you stand now .
Yes , I feel we're in a position hopefully to take up the business negotiation agai .
But in those uncertain days , about 2 weeks ago . Most of the exporters at our end didn't want to commit themselves .
US dollar devaluation was imminent and sterling was also under heavy pressure we couldn't afford to take any chance .
Yes we understand your positio .
And I'm glad the situation is taking a turn for the better .
Luckily we've pulled through this on solid footing . We have come personally to explain the position .
Good We look forward to doing business with you in the years to come .
Me too .
However the tallow market has been quite strong for some time and the prevailing price in the Australian market is around US dollars 303-mt for bulk tallow .
Oh Mr. Griffin as a state enterprise handling the import of tallow , I'm sure you expect us to do some investigation into prices before making an inquiry .
Your price is quite unreasonable .
It is ridiculous , if I may say so .
Well , I'm sorry to say that we find it quite unacceptable .
Could you give me an indication as to a price which you consider workable .
I suggest that you reconsider your price once more and bring it into line with the international market pric .
Well , I'd be glad to hear what price you have in mind .
I can only say that the prices from other sources are much lower than yours , and that their quality of tallow is very goo .
Mr. Zhao let's be frank , This is not the first time we've done business TOGETHER . We've always been straight and fair With Each Other : There's nothing serious to complain about , but the currency fluctuations could be responsible for some of our difficulties in pricing .
We really have been put in an awkward position because of thi .
Yes . It's good that our past record has always been satisfactory .
Still , I'm afraid you'll lose out if you don't fall into line with the prices of others .
I think I should explain briefly .
The rate of inflation around the world is from 3 , 9% while the rise in price for tallow is only 5% compared with our last transaction . The seeming 15% rise in our offer is caused by the precipitous slide of the dollar .
In other words , it's the rate of exchange of foreign currency that makes our price seem so unfavorable .
I think you should realize that .
Indeed we do .
But you should not neglect the advantage you enjoy in the cost of productio .
After all , we're quite prepared to come to terms with you if your price is reasonable .
Think it over Mr. Griffin .
Well I shall need more time as I have to contact my head offic .
That's fine .
Could you let us know as soon as you hear from them .
Certainly , I will .
Mr. Wang . I hope I'm not late .
Did you say 9 o'cloc .
Yes , Mr. Haffman You are here right on Time . We have just arrived too .
Good . Have you any news for me today , Mr. Wang .
We had a further look at your quotation after the talk yesterday afternoon after going through the world steel market situation in the last few days , we still feel that it is not enough for you to reduce your original price of $200 per M T by only 2% .
As I told you , yesterday in the past 6 months a surplus of steel has appeared in the Japanese American and Western European markets .
I'm afraid I can't agree with you there . Mr. Wang .
I grant that in the past half-year . The Japanese and Americans have sometimes found it difficult to sell their goods because of slight setbacks in the world economic situation . However we in Germany have had no problems .
Is that so .
Why the .
Because we always keep an eye on the East European market .
In this market , we have a geographical advantage compared with our competitors from Japan and the US .
But you should consider the fact that the Japanese are taking a more advantageous position than you are in trade with Chin .
That's true . Geographically speaking , but I should say that when you compare the price you should also compare the quality of the good your end users should have given you their comments on the quality of steel imports from different countries .
Yes . Yours is of good quality , but they did not tell us the imported steel from other sources is bad in quality .
In any case they regard our steel favorably and make no comments on steel imported from other sources .
You can make a comparison here , Mr. Wang .
Mr. Haffman , you really have a way of talking me into It . However , there still exists a large gap in price . Couldn't you take another step down and reduce the price by say 2% again and then perhaps we'll think your quotation workable .
I hate to disappoint you , Mr. Wang , but I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction .
Would you mind waiting a day or 2 until I get a reply from my home office .
Not at all . We'll wait one or 2 day .
I've brought you some good news Mr. Wang .
Has your corporation agreed to another reduction of 2% in price .
Yes . May I now repeat our offer as 5,000 M T steel specifications , as shown in our catalog at 192 US dollars zero zero per M T FOB Hamburg shipment Sep October 100900 92 .
Yes , that's it .
Mr. Wang . I tell you our offer holds firm for only one day . That means it is subject to your immediate acceptance .
Okay . We confirm our acceptance of your offer .
All right .
When shall I come to sign the contract .
What about tomorrow , say 10:00 AM .
Okay .
I understand this is your first visit to our corporation .
Yes , and also my first visit to CHINA . I've always wanted to see with my own eyes . China's achievements and now I've been more than rewarde .
Thank you . I hope you've had a pleasant trip .
I did . Thank you .
Well let's come to the point . The purpose of my coming here is to inquire about possibilities of establishing trade relations with your corporation .
That's fine .
Let me assure you of our best attention . Mr. Smith , what's your line of business .
Leathercrafts .
We are distributors with business branches in most major cities in America .
Now we'd like to introduce Chinese made leather crafts if your price is competitive and sales conditions are favorabl .
We'll see what we can do .
There might be quite a few kinds of your leather crafts , we would be interested in . May I go over your latest catalogs .
Sure Here You Are . How many copies . Would you like to have .
10 please .
I'd like to airmail some back hom .
Of course , that's a good idea .
Anything else .
Would it be all right for me to have a closer look at your samples .
Why no .
Mr. Chen over there will take you down to our showroom .
Thank you . I'm afraid I've taken a lot of your time .
Not at all .
Glad to have been of help .
Hope to see more of you when you are here in Beijing .
I hope so too .
Mr. Zhang director Liu has referred me to you for a discussion on our import requirements .
To begin with . I'd like to give you some information about our delegation .
The members of our delegation are the leading importers and suppliers of garments and textile goods for department stores in our country .
We're very pleased to be of help to you .
Welcome to beijing I can assure you of our close cooperation .
From what I have learned . I am sure we can develop business with your corporation on a large scale . I believe we can expect a fair deal between you and u .
Many business people speak highly of your commercial integrity .
We always adhere to the principle of equality and mutual benefit all contracts are honored and carried out to the lette .
So I've heard .
We hope we can have an opportunity to visit some textile mills here .
Yes , that can be arrange .
I'll let you know the time schedule later .
Thank yo .
Glad to meet you Mr. Scholtissek .
The purpose of inviting you to come here is to discuss the purchase of some long wall coal cutter .
Good .
Our coal cutters are very advanced in technology , aren't they .
Yes , they are a bit better than the coal cutters we just purchased from other countries .
But your price is skyrocketing and much higher than those from other countries .
Well , the way I think you shouldn't consider the price only but also its efficiency .
Yes , we are satisfied with the efficiency of your cutters but being short of foreign exchange . We must plan our purchases . According to our means .
Therefore , it's difficult for us to buy the coal cutters of your production this year .
Furthermore , those of other brands are not so bad at all .
If so , can we consider the possibility of undertaking compensation trade .
Why not .
We'd be happy to negotiate with you for such a deal .
Which do you prefer buy back or counter purchase .
I guess that buy back is easier .
Since we do often import a lot of coal from abroad . You can pay for the coal cutters with the coal produced by them .
That sounds very promisin .
Do you wish to have total compensation trade or a partial one .
It depends very much upon your payment capability .
In other words , the more you can produce in a given period of time . The sooner you will be able to pay for the cutter .
I understand the whole proces .
As for us , it's better to do total compensation trad .
It's quite alright to m .
Total compensation trade may be good for both of u .
For instance you'll buy from us . 4 coal-cutters at the unit price of 6 million us dollars all of them will be paid for with the coal produced by the machines .
We would like to know how long it will take to complete the payment .
Of course , the sooner the better .
If we do some calculation on the basis of the cutters' production capacity and the current price of coal . It will take about 2 years to complete the payment .
How do you like it .
May I say that your estimation does not seem to be 100% correct .
Compensation trade is in a way a kind of loan you need to pay the interest on the loan every year .
In that case , I'm afraid payment cannot be completed within 2 years .
You are right .
It can't be completed in 2 years .
Will 3 years be long enough .
I think so .
That's settled we'll complete payment within 3 years from the commencement of coal productio .
May I remind you of your definite responsibilities for technical assistance , the performance of the machines , and finally a smooth and successful start up .
Certainly we'll fulfill our obligations .
Meanwhile , it's our hope that you'll meet our requirements on the various quantity and quality specifications and the time of shipment for all the coal you deliver to us .
We'll certainly act in accordance with the contract terms .
Good .
Would you please get the draft contract ready as soon as possible .
Yes we will .
How are you . Mr. Tanaka .
I'm fine , thank you .
Mr. Zhao , I'm sorry to say that I don't bring any good news . With me this tim .
Well that is a surprise to ME What is the bad news .
It is rather beyond our expectation .
This year , our government has adopted a special license system for the import of textiles , including silk goods .
Oh , that's not too bad . As I understand it from now on silk goods can be imported only from the countries or regions nominated by the government .
Yes , no importation of silk goods is allowed from other than the 6 nominated countries or regions , which include China .
Is there any quantity limitation for the import of silk goods from China .
I'm Not Sure It all depends upon the government's regulations .
The imports have to apply for an import license for each specific purchase .
Considering the total number of the importers . We estimate that the maximum quantity of silk goods we can buy from China this year is about 50 million Japanese ye .
I know the import licenses were also required Last Year : How did you place an order for 60 million Japanese yen of silk goods last year .
Last year's regulations are no longer in effect this year . What the government issued to us last year was a general license .
Right Mr. Tanaka as I remember you placed an order of 60 million Japanese yen worth of silk goods last year , but in fact , only 30 million Japanese yen worth of silk goods were shipped owing to our heavy backlog of orders on hand and as a result , we could not fulfill your order completely .
Yes , that's true .
Is it possible to transfer the remaining part of the specified quantity of last year's import license to that of this year's import license .
No , it's not possibl .
It is the same as in China , the import license holds good only for one year in Japan .
That is to say the license of last year under which the import quantity is not fully used up is null and void now .
Right .
If you want to import again this year , you will have to apply for a new licens .
Why is your government so strict on the control of imports of silk goods .
It's probably designed to protect the silk textile industry in Japan or to avoid too many imports of silk goods .
Okay .
There's no point in discussing it further .
Whatever amount of an order from you is welcom .
I wish that you understand our situation .
We can only follow the government's directive .
I hope to get a general import license again next year .
If so I'll buy more from China .
I wish you every success .
All right .
Now shall we discuss something more concret .
Okay .
I was wondering if you would give us a response to our fax inquir .
Certainly .
We are pleased to offer you 120,000 cotton poplin blouses at 16.80 US dollars each FOB Xingang .
The blouses will be packed in plastic bags , each 4 dozens in a corrugated cardboard box .
They will be delivered in 2 consignments of 60,000 each , the first by August 20 and the second by September 1 .
The terms of payment will be the same as those in the previous contract that is sight letter of credi .
Thank you very much for your offer and we'll give it serious consideration .
As it'll take us some time to calculate , may I suggest we take a 20-minute break .
Then we'll give you an answer .
Fine .
Well Mr. Li I've discussed your offer with guy and I'm afraid we found it rather on the high side .
I wonder why you think s .
To be honest with you , just before we left for China . We were approached by a Filipino garments manufacturer .
His offer was 13.50 US dollars each blouse .
So we don't see why we should pay more for your blouses .
13.50 US dollars each blouse Really .
That's right . 13.50 US dollars .
That's really cheap .
I guess you must have bought a lot from hi .
We bought 1,000 pieces .
Only 1,000 .
Well , as we don't know much about that firm we just placed a trial order .
Right . It takes time to find out whether a business partner is trustworthy .
This is why we sent our inquiry to you .
I believe you are not only trustworthy but also competitive in pric .
You bet .
But your offer is obviously far from competitive .
Then what do you think would be a competitive pric .
$13.50 the price we paid the Filipino firm .
Oh come on our blouses certainly deserve more than that .
Oh why .
Because our quality is high and high quality goods deserve high price .
Mr. Bowen you wouldn't disagree on that , would you .
You may have a point there .
But how can you prove your blouses are better than the Filipino ones .
Our blouses are 100% natural , they are pure cotton .
Well , that's certainly a plus for you .
This year we have also won a gold medal from the best commodities Expo sponsored by the General Association of textiles .
Here is the certificate from the Associatio .
I take off my hat to you Mr. Li .
Thank you . But I think the best evidence , is this the orders we have received from overseas customers have doubled in the last 3 years .
This is our sales report .
Thank yo .
Well Mr. Bowen during the break I went over what we have already achieved .
So did I .
And I found that compared with what we have already agreed on our difference is almost nothing .
At this stage , I don't think you would like the idea of coming all the way to China only to go back home empty Handed and we don't want to see that either .
So it would be a crime if we let this one dollar difference stand in our way to the new contract .
That's tru .
So , I suggest we repeat what we did for the terms of payment and meet each other half way .
In other words , let's split the differenc .
Then it would be $15.40 .
I doubt if we can ever make any profit at this pric .
Sure you can .
I'll have to think about it .
Mr. Bowen , what you will sell is the most competitive blouses in the world .
If you advertise them well , they'll sell like hot cakes and you will be surprised at your profits .
Well , I'll take your word for it .
Good . We've come to an agreement at last .
Let me make a quick summary .
We'll sell you 120,000 cotton poplin blouses at 15.40 US dollars per piece FOB Xingang .
The blouses will be delivered in 2 consignments of 60,000 pieces each .
The first consignment will be paid by sight L C and the second by sight D P .
Am I correct .
Yes .
Great .
Now what do you suggest we work on next .
What about delivery .
Good .
We'll deliver the first consignment in 2 months that is by August 20 .
Could you make it a bit earlier .
Say , the beginning of August .
I'd like to deliver earlier , because if we did , so we could have the payment earlier but I can't give you a check , which I know will bounce .
Look , Mr. Li in our market , October is the season for this kind of blouse .
Look at this reverse timetabl .
The goods must clear the US customs before September 20 . If they are to reach our retailers by October .
September 20 . You'll still have one month , if we deliver the goods by August 20 .
Yes . But in order to clear the customs before September 20 . The goods must arrive at the port of destination before September 1st .
Why should the goods arrive so early .
Because the procedures . The imported textiles have to go through , can be outrageously time consuming .
20 days to pass the customs .
I really can't understand .
The US Customs has in the past few months become very picky on imported textiles .
It takes 10 days on average , but there have been cases in which it took one month to clear the customs .
So I must prepare for the worst .
I see .
Do you really think it's necessary Mr. Bowen to have a clause of claim .
We've been doing business for so many years .
I know and I must add that we've had a very pleasant relationship .
Then why do you still want this claim clause .
Just a sound business practice .
Let me give you an example .
I'm a great believer in Japanese consumer electronics .
I've bought a Japanese quartz watch a Japanese color TV set and a Japanese video recorder and none of them has given me any trouble .
Now suppose I want to buy a Japanese camcorder do I still need a warranty .
I figure you d .
Right , because I want to be 100% sure that the machine will not go wrong even if the chance is virtually nil .
This is also true for this contrac .
Being business partners for so long . We know each other's integrity perfectly well .
But there are factors which might be beyond our expectation or contro .
So neither of us should take chances .
All right . If you insist . Let's work on i .
How would you like to go about it .
I think there are 2 problems that may cause claims inferior quality and late delivery .
Inferior quality will force the garments to sell at a discount or to become completely unsalable .
On the other hand , late delivery will also cause problems because once you miss the season you'll miss the profit .
I agree .
Then what do you suggest we discuss first .
Shall we work on quality first .
Fine .
First I want to re-emphasize that on the whole , we've been satisfied with the quality of your products .
Thank you .
But I also want to point out that sometimes the quality of your products is inconsistent .
Could you give me an example .
We've received some complaints from our retailers about the buttonholing of some of the shirts in your last consignmen .
They said the stitches , are either too thick or too thin .
Well I'm afraid that kind of problem is unavoidable in mass production .
But the competition is fierce .
Our retailers said if they could find someone with better products they would no longer place orders with us .
This is why I insist on this claim claus .
You want to use this claim clause to remind us of the competition .
Exactly .
I hope I'll never have to invoke this clause and lodge a claim with yo .
I just want you to step into my shoes and feel the pressure .
All right . Well , it seems that you've already given a lot of thought to this issue . Do you have any specific proposal .
Yes . How about this .
If the defect rate is 1% . Then the penalty rate will be 1% of the contract value .
From 2% to 5% .
Wait a minute .
Could you , first of all , give me a clear definition of defect .
Any defect unevenly stitched buttonholes stains on the blouses improper hemming missing trimmings wrong labeling etc .
I think such defects fall into 2 types and we should work out different penalty rates for them .
Sounds reasonable .
But how would you categorize the defect .
The first type are major defects such as missing trimmings and stains on the blouses which may render the garments unsuitable for sale .
The second type are minor defects such as uneven stitches and improper hemming which will not make the garments unsalable .
The categorization is fine with me .
What about the penalty rate .
I suggest we use a flat rate for the penalt .
That is for each defective blouse . The penalty will be the value of the blous .
Does this rate apply to major defects or minor one .
Major ones .
For minor ones the penalty will be 20% of the valu .
Your rate is surely simple to calculate . But as I said before , I do not insist on this claim clause because we want to eventually use it .
Rather , I hope there will be no defect or as few defects as possible so that we'll never have to lodge a claim with you .
In this spirit . I suggest we adopt a progressive penalty rate .
Could you spell it out .
For major defects if the defect rate does not exceed 0.1% . The penalty rate will be% of the contract value from 0.1% to 0.5% , inclusive the penalty rate will be 1% from 0.5% to 1% , inclusive the penalty rate will be 30% from 1% to 5% , inclusive the penalty rate will be 70% .
The penalty rate will be 200% and the whole lot will be returned to you if the defect rate exceeds 5% .
Do you really think it should be this complicated .
I'm afraid . My answer is yes , but I hope we'll never have to use it .
All righ .
I think this progressive rate is actually more to my advantage , because I have confidence in my products .
I'm glad to hear that .
So shall we apply the same principle to the minor defects .
Why not .
If I remember correctly this is the 18th contract I've signed with Dafa garment .
You are right .
My hunch is that this contract will become a milestone in our relationship .
Why .
Because 18 is a lucky number in Chinese .
I see .
But well Mr. Li I'm afraid we both have to make extra efforts if our relationship is to develop further .
I agre .
We've always appreciated the competitiveness of your prices . But as I said earlier , the quality of your garments is sometimes inconsistent and the delivery is not always on schedule .
I have to admit that's true .
We were lucky that our sales did not suffer much as a result , but we cannot always count on our luck , don't you agree . Mr. Li .
I agree .
The problem is that the pressure on us for fast delivery has increased greatly .
I remember that 10 years ago , you would be happy if we shipped the goods in 3 months .
But in the past few years . You've often asked us to deliver in 2 months or even sooner .
Because the time we have to respond to our clients' tastes has also become unbearably Limited .
And if we can't satisfy our clients' needs in time they will certainly turn to our competitors .
We've tried our best to be punctual , but sometimes it was just impossible to deliver on Time and sometimes we had to rush and as a result , the quality might have suffered .
In our letter of intent and the subsequent communications . We've agreed on the principles of the compensation trade package .
That is , we will provide you with advanced garments machinery and you will compensate us with garments .
Correct .
We've further agreed that , in order to minimize the costs the machines can be second hand so long as their specifications and conditions satisfy your needs .
That's right .
So far I've received 3 offers of second-hand garment machinery .
Before we visit the factories and negotiate with the owners , however , I'm afraid we should first agree on how to finance the package .
How to finance the package .
I don't quite understand .
You just buy the machines and we'll compensate you with garments .
It means that we the seller will provide the credit .
Or in other words , we will finance the trade .
Now I see what you mean . But that's what the compensation trade is all about .
I'm afraid it's entirely possible for it to be the other way round .
That is , you sell us the garments first and we give you the machines late .
That's certainly another possibility but it is rather rare in compensation trade and simply won't work in our case .
We need the machines before we can improve our quality and delivery . Not after .
Well , you certainly have a point there .
So we'll have to finance it .
Now , the problem is how much the total payment i .
Now let's work on something else .
Shall we discuss the method for compensation .
Fine .
I suggest that every time you make a purchase . You don't have to physically pay for it . Its value will be deducted from what we owe you .
This will continue until you are fully compensated .
I'm afraid we should not tie the 2 payments togethe .
Why .
I think this will reduce the financing costs and save both of us a lot of trouble .
Sure , it will reduce costs and save trouble but I'm afraid . It's not a sound business practic .
Why .
Because there is no guarantee that both of us will be paid properly .
What if we can't buy from you or you can't sell to us in the middle of the compensation .
I'm afraid you're a bit too pessimistic . Mr. Bowen .
Well Mr. Li we both know that anything could happen in international business , and we should leave no risk unattended .
Very well , whatever you say .
In the best interests of both you and me . I suggest that we make separate payments for machines and garments .
All right .
Now let's look at the terms of payment .
What's your suggestion for that .
I suggest payment with either L C or collections depending on which is our priority security or costs .
I'd prefer L C because what we'll be involved in is no small deal .
Security should come first .
It will do both of us . Good , don't you agree . Mr. Li .
I d .
So we'll open separate L C's for machines and garment .
Yes .
You'll open a 180 day since L C depending on the final figure of our financing .
And we'll open a sight L C each time we make a purchase from you .
I have no objection .
Now that you have our guarantee that your money will be paid back in time . I think it is fair for us to ask you for the same .
What's tha .
Would you please also guarantee that by the time our usance L C is due the accumulative value of your purchase from us will be the same as that of our L C .
I'll try my best .
I'm afraid that's not a guarantee .
I'd like to buy as much as possible from you . But as I said earlier , there are many uncertainties .
Granted , but if you don't buy from us , where can we find the money to pay you back .
I didn't say we wouldn't buy from you .
Besides Wilshire fashion is not the only source of your revenue .
You have many other client .
That's true , but it's just not fair .
You have our guarantee and we don't have your .
I've said , we'll do our best .
And I've also said it's not a guarantee .
It seems we'll get nowhere . If we go on like THIS well as it's already quite late . Shall we agree on the general principles today and work out the details later .
All right .
I agree to the general principle of separate payments but I'll raise the issue of counter guarantee again after we visit the factories .
Okay .
How much is your offer for this machine .
I'm a very reasonable man .
Look , this is the original invoice for this machin .
See the original price .
And as you're from such a remote country I'll sell them to you at half of the original price .
Thank you .
But as the date of the invoice indicates this machine has been in use for already 4 years .
You're right .
And we usually depreciate our machinery in 10 years , so it still has 3 fifths of the original value .
My friend told me on our way here that most garment makers here in the States depreciate their machinery in just 5 years .
So this machine is worth only one 5th of its original value .
That's not the way I calculate .
All right , very soon . We'll find out the main stream practice as we will visit a few more garments makers .
I think we should add a clause saying that Ho's clothing should provide all the technical documentation so that the machines will run properly .
Right .
In addition , I suggest that Dafa garments have a representative when the machines are dismantled packed and shipped .
Without his consent the machines would be considered unacceptabl .
Well , I have no objection .
As I'm going back very soon . I'll send my chief engineer to oversee the dismantlemen .
But it'll take at least 2 weeks for your chief engineer to get the vis .
Do you want to wait that long .
I think I can wait .
The travel will cause additional expenses .
I think it's worth it .
I want to make double sure that the machines are the ones we want to buy and that they are in good shape .
Surely you want to do that .
Here I want to emphasize that you and your people have my utmost trust .
The reason I want to send my chief engineer here is very simple . He is the best person to make sure we get everything that is needed for the machines to run properly in China .
I would do the same if I were yo .
According to the contract , the total payment for the machines is $254,300 , very close to Mr. Li's original bid .
It's a real bargain .
Thank you so much . Mr. Bowen .
Don't mention it we're partners aren't w .
Right .
Now that we've got the exact figure for the total payment . I think it's time to draft a formal agreement for the package .
I hope we can sign it in the coming Monda .
Let Mr. Yang do the drafting .
You have worked very hard this week . So both of you should have your weekend off .
I'll ask my secretary to do the job .
Well , it's almost 4 o'clock .
I'll dictate the draft to her as soon as I'm back at my offic .
I think she'll have the full blown agreement ready for your approval Monday afternoon .
Good .
If you find the agreement satisfactory we can sign it in the same afternoon .
Fantastic .
I'd like to make a little change .
I'll open a 120-day usance L C for the 2 thirds of your financin .
The balance will be covered by another L C depending on the amount of your purchase .
Oh come on Mr. Li you've again tied the 2 payments together .
No , they are still separate .
We only want some guarantee just as you did to us .
Remember that it is we who finance the deal and as the beneficiary you are obliged to make the full payment .
I didn't say I wouldn't do that .
What I mean is that as a partner in compensation trade , you also have Your obligation that is to go on purchasing our garments until the compensation is complete .
That's what compensation trade is all about .
Well Mr. Li you've really got me there .
I just want to make it fairer .
All righ .
What about paying 4 fifths first .
I'm afraid 3 quarters are the best I can accept .
Well , well , I guess there is no other way out is there .
If you agree to this , would you please revise the agreement accordingl .
All right .
To be frank with you . Mr. Li I'm beginning to doubt if it is wise at all for us to tie ourselves up like this .
All these inconveniences will far outweigh the gains . If there are any . We can get from this deal .
Don't be so pessimistic . Mr. Bowen .
As a Chinese proverb has it never fear if you're well prepared .
And to quote a famous phrase of yours . It's a sound business practice .
The reality may be far brighter than it look .
What makes you so optimisti .
We've prepared for the worst . That is if your purchase from us cannot offset what we owe you .
Experiences show that the worst will probably not happen if you are fully prepared for it .
More often than not , you'd end up with something far better than what you are prepared for .
That's pure theory .
It may well be the reality .
What if we receive one or several big orders from other clients .
Then we would have enough cash to pay you back in full well ahead of schedule .
Sounds good .
I'm serious and that reminds me of the second point I'd like to discus .
What's that .
The formula you proposed in the draft to calculate the interest of your financin .
Is there anything wrong with it .
Nothing wrong .
I just want to make it more flexible .
That's interesting , but ho .
Well , could you , first of all , tell me how you make the calculation .
At the present the going rate is 3.6% per annum .
So , the interest for 6 months is 2.4% of our financing .
That's correct , if we complete the compensation in 6 month .
But as I said earlier , what if we are able to do it sooner .
Do you really mean to do it sooner .
Why not if we receive enough cash as you said earlier from other source .
That'll reduce our payment for the interest .
I see what you mean .
So do you agree to make the calculation , more flexible .
Yes I do .
I suggest we have separate clause for interest payment .
Okay .
The payment of interest shall be calculated as follows .
Excellent .
Now we've taken care of the best , as well as the worst .
Anything else would you like to discuss .
I'm perfectly happy with the rest of the draft .
Very good .
I'll ask my secretary to revise the agreement , according to our discussion this morning .
I think the new version will be ready for our signatures this afternoon .
Good .
Please tell me a bit more about exclusive sales arrangements in China .
Are they different from such arrangements here in the States .
I think they're basically the same , the world around the exporter authorizes the importer to be the sole dealer of the farmer's products .
If the exporter has several product lines . Could he specify which product lines he wants included in the arrangemen .
Yes .
Based on his judgment of importer's strength and channel of distribution , the exporter can also specify the area in which the importer can sell the specified products .
It can be one city several provinces or the whole country .
What about the length of such an arrangement .
It depends . Usually one year .
Here in the States . We do not specify the Length instead we have a clause of termination or renewal of the arrangement in the related agreement .
That seems more flexible .
What about the volume of the busines .
It's also specified in the arrangement expressed in either quantity or value .
Once agreed upon , it is the obligation of the parties involved to sell or buy the specified amount of products .
Any other obligations .
Yes .
The exporter is obliged to sell the specified products during the specified period to nobody but the importer .
The importer has his own obligations too that is during the specified period he should buy from the exporter only if his country's law permit .
What if the importer does not make a profit .
Well , he has nobody but himself to blame because in an exclusive sales arrangement , the relationship between the exporter and the importer is principal to principal .
This means each party is responsible for his own profits or losses .
That's the same her .
Now assume that you have an agency arrangement in China is the relationship different .
Yes .
In an agency arrangement , the owner of the goods authorizes an individual or a firm to be his agent .
The agent does business on behalf of the goods' owner .
So it's a principal to agent relationshi .
You're right .
The owner of the goods is the principal .
The agent operates with the principal's funds and sells goods for him but is not responsible for the losses or the profits of the operatio .
Sounds like an easy jo .
I know you are kiddin .
Every agent will do his best to maximize sales for his principal because he lives on commission , which is usually a percentage of the sales he makes .
The more sales . He makes the more commissions . He will get .
That's righ .
In the States . There are basically 3 types of agents commission agents exclusive agents and general agents .
It's the same in China .
A commission agent is not exclusive .
The principal can appoint one or several commission agents in the same area at the same tim .
After the agents are appointed can the principal sell directly to buyers in the same area without the involvement of the agent .
He can and if this is the case , the agent will get no commissio .
The poor agent .
Once the principal is familiar with an agent and is convinced of the agent's strength he may appoint the latter as the exclusive agent for a certain area .
In an exclusive agency arrangement only one agent can be appointed . In the same area at the same tim .
So the agent enjoys exclusive rights .
Right .
Direct sales by the principal are still allowed but the principal has to pay the agent commission , no matter who sells the goods unless otherwise stipulated .
That's fair because in such an arrangement , the agent is not allowed to sell goods made by the principal's competitor .
That's right .
The 3rd type of agents are general agents .
A general agent represents the principal in a bigger area and is given more authorization .
He can also appoint agents working under him and share their commissions .
It's quite similar her .
Well , there seems to be little difference between us , so long as agency is concerned , right .
We do have a lot in common .
As China opens her door wider to the world more international norms will be adopted in her relations with other countries .
You've been most informative Mr. Li .
It's my pleasure to help other people learn about China .
And I'd like to learn more .
But before we go on . Could I have a refill .
Go ahead . And I'd like to do the same .
Well this wine tastes great .
It's dynasty brewed in China .
So I've noticed .
As a matter of fact the brewery is a Sino-French joint venture .
Pardon . What kind of joint venture .
A Sino-French joint ventur .
Really .
It seems more and more foreign firms have investments in China .
That's right .
The foreign investment in China has more than quadrupled in the past decade .
That's great .
Could you tell me why it has increased so fast .
These are 2 reasons .
First , the Chinese government has done everything it can to attract foreign investment .
Second , for many foreigners . It will be more profitable . If they have direct investment in China than if they just trade with China .
Could you give me some example .
Sure .
As I'm in garments business could I use garments as an example .
Sure .
In international garments trading . Most of the exporters are in developing countries like China .
We have cheap labor , land , buildings and raw materials but lack funds technology and managerial expertise .
So if a foreigner invests in China with funds technology and managerial expertise , he'll have the best of everything and can thus maximize his profits .
Sounds encouragin .
Mr. Li , where do you think is the best place to invest in China .
The coastal cities have many advantages as transportation and communications facilities there are much better than those in inland cities .
But as China speeds up its economic reform many inland cities are catching up quickly .
I se .
What kind of , forms does foreign investment in China . Usually take .
Well , there are compensation trade co exploration joint venture business solely owned by foreigners , just to name a fe .
Could you explain them one by one .
Sur .
Compensation trade sometimes also called counter trade or simply CT is just what the name suggests .
In such kind of trade , the foreign partner usually supplies machinery and technology and the home partner then compensates the foreign partner with products made with the machinery and technolog .
Got it .
Yes , thank you .
What's the second type of investment . You mentioned .
Co exploration also called co-development .
You know . Countries like China are rich in natural resources but lack the funds to exploit them .
So the government sometimes enters agreement with foreign investors for natural resource exploration .
Could you give me some examples .
In the past decade . The Chinese government has signed contracts with American , French , British and Dutch oil companies for the exploration of China's offshore oil .
How much do foreign companies have to invest in such co exploration .
At least millions of dollars .
How much are the risks .
I should say the risks are also great .
If the venture fails to find oil the loss could also be in the millions .
I'm afraid the risks are too great to tak .
The risks are great because no one can guarantee he can find oil every time he sinks a well .
But the gains must also be huge . If the oil is foun .
Right .
If oil is found the foreign investor will be given priority in the actual exploitation of the oil fiel .
Then the profits will pour in .
Good .
Now what's next . The joint venture .
Yes .
A joint venture is a business with both Chinese and foreign investments .
Oh Mr. Bush how I envy yo .
Oh why .
As a sportswear maker . You must have a huge market in such a sports superpower as your country .
The market is surely huge but the competition is also fierce .
That's for sure .
Who doesn't want a bite of such a lucrative business .
Exactly .
So we're looking for ways to outperform our competitors .
Could you tell me a bit more about IT : That is , if it's not a business secret .
It's no secret at all .
In the past few months we've been considering the possibility of transferring some of our manufacturing to China as a way to reduce production costs .
Our marketing people have done some studies , but their data are mostly second han .
I guess this is why you came to this part .
You're right .
I'd like to have some face to face contact with people like you .
Now Mr. Li could you tell me if we are to set up a manufacturing company in China . What would be the best way to go about it .
You may set up a company completely owned by yourselves or a joint venture with a Chinese partner .
What would be the advantages and disadvantages of a company completely of our ow .
You can run the company in whatever way you like and take all the risks as well as the profit .
I see .
The major disadvantage is that you have to provide all the financing and take all the risks because the company is your own bab .
Sounds like a lot of Responsibilities What about a joint venture .
As the name suggests , a joint venture is a business with both Chinese and foreign investment .
The 2 partners can bring to the venture capital funds land machinery building technology labor or any other things which may contribute to the venture .
I guess the foreign partner's investment will come mostly in the form of capital funds machinery and technology .
Right .
The Chinese usually bring in land building labor and funds in renminbi . The Chinese currency .
So compared with a solely foreign owned company , a joint venture imposes a much smaller financial burden on the foreign investor .
So I believe .
But as both partners have investment they both must have a say in the management of the venture .
Correct .
Both partners will have representatives on the board of directors and the management .
Then I'd imagine that it would be much more complicated to run a joint venture than a company of my own .
My answer is both . Yes and no .
Because the board of directors and managers come with different backgrounds some misunderstandings and even conflicts are unavoidable , especially at the beginning .
But if both sides keep their mutual interests in mind and try their best to adjust to the new relationship . The venture may eventually benefit rather than suffer from such mixed managemen .
Sounds interesting , but could you tell me why it may benefit rather than suffer .
Because the venture operates in China . The mixed management can appreciate this special environment better and therefore function better than an all foreigner management .
I think you've answered all my questions about joint ventures .
Thank you very much . Mr. Li .
Sure .
In effect , Mr. Bush . We are also looking for possibilities to set up a joint venture .
So I was wondering if you would be interested in becoming our partner .
Surely I am .
I'll give your proposal serious consideration after this party and let you know as soon as I have something firm .
I'll do the same .
So keep in touc .
I will .
Well , I think it's time to refill our glasse .
Right .
I'm here to ask about the movie projectors you wanted me to distribute to our outlets .
Do you mean our new built in projectors .
That's right .
What's the price range .
They start at around $100 and go up to a couple of hundred dollars for purchases of a dozen .
Are those prices , FOB or CIF .
They are fob .
Well , I'm thinking of ordering some 10 or 20 dozen .
Then why don't you take a look at our family model .
It's made especially for exporting and is priced at $85 .
That sounds interesting .
Let me see one .
What do you think of the exhibit .
Excellent .
Which items . Do you think can be sold in your market .
There is a strong demand for Chinese pottery in our market , I think .
It has not been decided , how much we will pay for advertising expenses .
As the selling agent , we usually pay 40% of the expenses and you as the manufacturer usually pay 60 .
I think it's more reasonable that you pay 60% and we pay 40% .
But it is a new product , it seems unreasonable for us to pay most of the advertising expenses .
Let's try to look for a compromise .
I'm sure we can find a wa .
Mr. Baker , I'd like to discuss the indemnity clause .
All right . What's your opinion .
As you know , buyers always want prompt delivery .
It is important we get the raw materials on Time otherwise you must compensate for all the losses .
I think we'd better talk this over in detail .
Yes , I've prepared a draft on the Details : let's discuss it after a cup of coffee .
All right . I'm sure we can reach an agreement soo .
Let's begin to discuss the payment terms .
Can we buy on credit .
Not at this tim .
You know , we have a cash flow problem and we prefer cash .
I understand your positio .
Can we pay by check if necessary .
That's okay . But we won't deliver goods until your check is accepted by the bank .
Then I have to agree with you on this point .
I'm glad to have the opportunity of visiting your corporation .
I hope we can do business together .
It's great pleasure to meet you Mr. Clive , I believe you have seen our exhibits in the showroom What is it in particular you're interested in .
I'm interested in your hardwar .
I've seen the exhibits and studied your catalogs . I think some of the items will find a ready market in Canada .
Here's a list of requirements . I'd like to have your lowest quotations CIF Vancouve .
Thank you for your inquir .
Would you tell us what quantity you require so that we can work out the offers .
I'll do that .
Meanwhile , could you give me an indication of the pric .
Here are our FO B Price all the prices in the lists are subject to our confirmation .
What about the commissio .
From European suppliers . I usually get a 3% to 5% commission for my imports .
It's the general practice .
As a rule . We do not allow any commission .
But if the order is a sizable one we'll consider it .
You see , I do business on a commission basis .
A commission on your prices would make it easier for me to promote sales .
Even 2 or 3% would help .
We'll discuss this when you place your order with us .
May I see the manager .
I'm afraid he isn't IN Is there anything I can do for you .
Yes I have brought some catalogs of machine tools .
I wonder if any of your end users would like to have a look at them .
They certainly would .
Would you leave them with me .
We are suppliers of machine tools of various types .
I think your end users will be interested in some of our new products .
We're thinking of ordering some special kinds of machine tools .
We would be interested in your products if they are of the types we want .
As you probably know , we also take orders for machine tools made according to specifications .
How long would it take you to deliver the orders .
3 months at most after receipt of the covering L C .
It would take longer to deliver the special orders though never longer than 6 months .
Very well , I'll send your catalogs to those who are interested in them .
Meanwhile , may I have an indication of the price .
Can I have your price sheet .
Yes , of course , here you are .
Our prices compare most favorably with quotations . You can get from other manufacturers .
You'll see that from our price sheet .
The prices are subject to our confirmation naturally .
All your quotations are on an fo B Vancouver basis . May I ask if you allow any discount .
Please tell me what you have in mind .
From European suppliers , we usually get a 5% discount and sometimes 10% .
If your order is large enough we'll consider giving you some discount .
Fine , we'll negotiate after we decide how many machine tools , we are going to order from you .
When shall I hear from you .
Next Friday .
Well we've settled the question of price , quality and quantity .
Now what about the terms of payment .
We only accept payment by irrevocable letter of credit payable against shipping documents .
I see . Could you make an exception and accept D A or D  .
I'm afraid not . We insist on a letter of credi .
To tell you frankly a letter of credit would increase the cost of my import when I open a letter of credit with a bank . I have to pay a deposit .
That'll tie up my money and all to my cost .
Consult your bank and see if they will reduce the required deposit to a minimum .
Still , there will be bank charges in connection with the credit .
It would help me greatly if you would accept D A or D P .
You can draw on me just as if there were a Letter of Credit It makes no great difference to you but it does to me .
Well Mr. Schmidt , you must be aware that an irrevocable letter of credit gives the exporter . The additional protection of the banker's guarantee .
We always require L C for our Exports And the other way round . We pay by L C for our imports .
To meet you halfway . What do you say 50% by L C and the balance by D P .
I'm very sorry Mr. Schmidt , but I'm afraid I can't promise you even that .
As I've said we require payment by L C .
To get around your difficulty Mr. Schmidt , I'd suggest that you reduce your order by Half You can send in an additional order late .
Well I'll consider the possibilit .
By the way , when do I have to open the L C if I want the goods to be delivered in June .
A month before the time you want the goods to be delivered .
Could you possibly effect shipment more promptl .
Getting the goods ready making out the documents and booking the shipping space . All this takes time , you know .
You cannot expect us to make delivery in less than a mont .
Very well . Mr. Zhang I will not reduce my order . I'll take the full quantity you offer .
And I'll arrange for the L C to be opened in your favor . As soon as I get home .
When will that be .
Early next month .
In the meantime I should be very pleased if you would get everything ready . I hope that the goods can be dispatched promptly after you get my L C .
You can rest assured of that .
We'll book your order and inquire for the shipping space now so that shipments can be effected within 2 or 3 weeks of receipt of your L C .
That'll be FINE . I appreciate your cooperation .
Very good Well thanks to your cooperation .
Our discussion has been very pleasant and fruitful .
I sincerely hope that the volume of trade between us will be even greater in the future .
By the way Mr. Zhang , we hope to participate in joint ventures with you on Chinese arts and crafts in our market , would you consider this proposal .
Well , this is something new . A few of our friends from Europe have also suggested that we participate in joint enterprise with them dealing in some of our goods .
We think there are a lot of details to go into .
If you feel our proposal is appropriate . It is estimated that business to the extent of over 20 million marks can be done in this manner .
Naturally , I appreciate your efforts in pushing the sale of Chinese Arts and Crafts but I'm not in a position to discuss your proposal today I must first talk to our director and discuss it with you some other time .
Alright . Anyway , I'll be staying here for another 2 Weeks . But I'm looking forward to having something done about this .
We'll talk about it next time .
Now that everything is settled , let's have a cup of tea and get our minds off business for a change .
Mr. Lin I'm anxious to know about your offer .
Well , we've been holding it for you . Mr. Smith here : It is 500 cases of black tea at $20 per kilogram CIF liverpool shipment will be in July .
That's a high price .
It'll be difficult for us to make any sale .
I'm rather surprised to hear you say that Mr. Smit .
You know the price of black tea has gone up since last year .
Our price compares favorably with what you might get elsewhere .
I'm afraid I can't agree with you there .
India has just come into the market with a lower price .
But everybody in the tea trade knows that China's black tea is of top quality .
Considering the quality , I should say the price is reasonable .
No doubt yours is of a high quality , but still there is keen competition in the tea market .
I understand some countries are actually lowering their price .
So far , our commodities have stood the competition . Well .
The very fact that other clients . Keep on buying speaks for itsel .
Few other teas can compare with ours either for flavor or color .
But I believe we'll have a hard time convincing our clients at your pric .
To be frank with you if it weren't for our good relations we wouldn't consider making you a firm offer at this price .
All right . In order to close the deal . I accept .
I'm glad that we've settled the pric .
Now about the quantity you said you could offer me only 500 cases , which I think is not enough . Last year we sold 700 cases and I'm sure I can do better this year . I hope you can offer me at least 800 cases .
Because of the rapid growth of both our domestic and foreign markets , our production hasn't been able to keep pace with the demand 500 cases , is the best I can offer you at presen .
I see . But if I don't take care of the supply of my market my customers will naturally turn somewhere else for their needs .
Sorry , I don't think we can offer you more than 500 cases this yea .
As a matter of fact , we have made a special effort to get these 500 cases for you .
All right . We'll take the 500 cases . This time , but I do hope you can supply more next time .
We'll see if we can do better next year .
We've studied your offer on wheat and find it out of line with the world marke .
It doesn't seem very hopeful to close the deal . On that basi .
Would you please reconsider i .
Well , this is our rock bottom price Mr. Li .
No further concession can be made .
Mr. Smith , if that is the case , there is no need for further discussion .
I'm thinking that we might as well call the whole deal off .
What I mean is that the gap between your price and ours is too GREAT There is no way out .
To be frank with you . Mr. Smith , the price you quoted is impossible .
I can show you that we can buy wheat from Australia , at a price 20% lower than yours .
The price varies according to the quality .
I can quote you on wheat of low quality and the price will be comparatively lo .
You needn't tell me this .
The reason that we sent you inquiries is that we usually found your quotations rather reasonable .
I think it unwise for either of us to insist on this price .
How about meeting each other halfway .
In this way , we may be able to conclude the business .
What is your concrete proposal .
When I suggest that we meet each other halfway . I mean it literally .
You mean you reduce the price by 10% . I still think it is rather high .
I'm disappointed at what you have just said . That's really our rock bottom PRICE I have to take the cost into consideration : There is nothing more I can do now .
Let me See can we once more meet each other halfway on that basis .
Then if you agree , we'll close the deal . I hope you won't miss the chance to get this busines .
We can very well buy wheat from Australia .
However , you are our old supplier in order to keep up our good business relations we choose to negotiate business with you and to buy from yo .
May I repeat that if you are not interested in this business . We'll soon purchase from Australia . We cannot afford to wait for you very long .
You certainly have a way of talking me into it .
All right , let's meet each other halfway again .
I'm very glad that we have finally come to an agreement , we'll go on to other terms and conditions . TOMORROW is it all right to you .
Very good . See you tomorrow .
Mr. Gao , would you give us an idea of the price you regard as workable .
As I said before your price is so high that we find it difficult to make a bid . We hope you will take the initiative and bridge the ga .
We're ready to reduce the price by 5 Percent . I hope this concession of ours will set the ball rolling .
So do we .
I'm afraid though Mr. Hoffmann that the ball can hardly roll very far .
Certainly it's a step forward on Your Side but the gap is still too wide .
The ball is with you Mr. Gao What price would you suggest step down as big as the one you've just take .
To make your offer workable . I think you should take another step down as big as the one you've just taken .
That won't do .
You see our profit margin is very narrow it simply can't stand such a big cut .
I hate to disappoint you Mr. Hoffmann but if that's the case , we have no alternative but to cover our requirements elsewhere .
Do think it over . PLEASE we sincerely hope our discussion will come to a success .
Well I'm not authorized to agree to such a big reduction Would you mind waiting a day or 2 until I get a reply from the Home Office .
Not at all .
Shall we meet again say on Friday morning .
Good Friday morning at 9 .
Any good news .
Well , I can hardly say THAT . However , I'm still hopefu .
Have you got a reply from your head office .
Yes , I've received a long cable actually , there's nothing new to offer .
Do you mean the price remains the same as that mentioned yesterday .
Yes , it is the same , but let me point out that the tallow market conditions have been anything but easy of late .
The recent currency crisis has not made things any better .
Would you enlighten me . Further , as to the market conditions .
I believe that you have followed up the supply position and that you're as well informed as I a .
Could you tell us about the supply position at your end .
As you know , situations are apt to change in the commodity market as far as tallow supplies are concerned , there are most pressing demands from clients in other parts of the WORLD . The upward trend is quite strong .
I hope you will appreciate our position .
I gather from what you say that the outlook is not very promising .
It's rather disappointing that you should come all the way from Australia to tell us of such a bleak prospect .
Things are not all that bad .
You may recall that we once drew your attention to drummed tallow .
As regards this item . The situation is slightly better .
If you could accept this . Instead , we could supply the quantity you require .
We are not interested in drummed tallow for the simple reason that its price is higher .
I appreciate that .
But there is a very strong trend in its favor on the international market .
We are having difficulty in getting hold of any sizable parcels of bulk tallow for immediate shipment .
I may tell you that India has just entered the market with an inquiry for 6,000 tons .
This certainly has its effect on our market and also in the USA and Canada .
We know this , but the question is whether they will agree to such a high price .
In any case there simply aren't any sizable parcels around .
As the situation stands now we can offer only 1,000 tons bulk tallow at the price quoted yesterday .
If you can get your end users interested in drummed tallow , we'll do our best to offer more say 3,000 tons , with an additional charge for the drums and the drumming cost at 45 US dollars per ton .
I'm sorry I can't entertain your proposition .
Well , then there is nothing I can do , but to make a long distance call home tonight to see once more . What can be done .
Please do . I hope to hear from you soon .
I'll appreciate it if you will give us a counter-offer .
I'm afraid that can't be done .
Unless you propose something definite together with some improvement in your price . We are not inclined to place a large order with you .
However , in view of the friendly relations between us we are willing to hold negotiations with you again . The day after tomorrow .
I'll get in touch with my head office right away .
How do you find our offer on heavy-duty trucks Mr. Gao .
I'm afraid you're facing a stiff competition from other suppliers .
We Are it's expected .
Everyone in the trade knows you're in the market , I think we stand a good chance .
I'm not so Sure It all depends .
We're prepared to cooperate to the best we CAN you see we are the biggest manufacturers of trucks in Italy and our make is one of the best in the world , if not the number One , we know where we stand .
How do your trucks compare with Germany's .
But their prices are higher .
Do you think your prices are in keeping with the German make when the quality is taken into consideration .
I should think so .
I'm afraid I can't agree with you there .
On the other hand , you're also facing the competition from the Japanese , whose prices are much lower than those of yours .
I think you know the situation fairly well .
But the quality of theirs compares much lower with ours .
All right . Would you give us a counter offer then .
Your prices are so high that we find it difficult to give you any counter offer , I hope you'll take the initiative in bridging the gap .
I'm not in a position to agree to any further Reduction Would you mind waiting a day or 2 before I get a reply from my home office .
Good please ring me up as soon as you have any news to tell us .
Congratulations , Mr. Li .
All right . What about $14.40 each blouse .
I'm afraid your concession it by almost 7% .
I appreciate your effort toward reaching an agreement , but I'm afraid your concession is too moderate .
Oh come on Mr. Li .
You'll drive us bankrupt if you raise the price any further .
You can't be serious . Mr. Bowen .
As an expert in garments business you know our blouses are worth much more than your counter offer .
Thanks for the compliment .
But as an expert . I don't think your offer is in alignment with the prevailing price in the marke .
I'm afraid I can't go along with you on tha .
However , to show our goodwill to an old friend , let me cut my offer also by 90 cents and make it $15.90 .
What do you say to that .
Thank you very much . But I have to say we still can't afford to pay at that price .
I'm surprised to hear that .
Well then , I'd appreciate it if you make the next move .
Mr. Li . I hate to say this but I am already in a tight corner and can't move any more .
Well it seems to be a real hard-nut to crac .
Well , I've got an idea .
Why don't we forget about the price for the time being and discuss something else .
Perhaps we'll stumble upon a mutually satisfactory solution for price later o .
An excellent idea .
Well , what do you suggest we discuss for the time being .
Shall we discuss the terms of payment .
Well , that's certainly a possibility .
We should be prudent when doing business , but you will also agree with me that we should not get overcautious .
You know Wilshire Fashion it's no longer the tiny company , it was 20 years ago .
It is not due to financial difficulty that we ask for payment by D A or D P .
Here is our annual report of last year .
You can see from this report that we enjoy a very solid financial standing .
Your present standing is impressive , but a business firm's future is somewhat unpredictable , don't you agree .
I'm afraid I can't go along with you there . So long as my company is concerned .
How can I convince you .
Well if you still feel insecure let me meet you half way and pay the first consignment by sight L C and the second by sight D P .
You will not lose a penny . If you accept this arrangement but it will save us a great deal .
Well , please give me some TIME I'll consult with my colleagues .
Sure .
Well , it's already 11:30 . And I'm a bit hungry .
Shall we adjourn for lunch now and resume the negotiation at 2 o'clock this afternoon .
Yes , I need to re-energize myself too .
So in order to arrive by September 1st . The goods must leave Xingang before August 10 .
Well , you do have a very tight schedule here .
Perhaps you should have made the order a bit earlier .
I wish I could but the people's tastes for garments change so fast .
Therefore in order to make a better prediction as to which design will win us customers , we have to wait until just 2 or 3 months before the season .
The nearer the season draws the better we can predict .
I see . But that will place greater pressure on the garments manufacturer .
That's true . And this is why garments makers are now competing not only in quality and price , but also in speed of delivery .
The sooner you can make the delivery , the more orders you will have .
I'd like to make an early delivery but my factories are already working at full capacity .
Can you rearrange your schedule and make my order your top priorit .
All right , I'll rearrange the production schedule .
But the best I can do is to deliver the blouses 5 days earlier that is by August 15 .
I really appreciate that . But could you make it a few more days earlier . Mr. Li .
I'm sorry but I can' .
All right that's settled .
August 15 .
Why don't you hire more people .
I'm afraid more labor is not the answer .
It is our machines .
They're obsolete inefficient and unreliable .
Then , have you thought of buying newer and better machines .
For example , those with micro processors .
They are versatile and efficient can do all kinds of tricks , but many times faster than human Hands and the quality is very consistent .
I know , but they are also very expensive .
Surely it's a big investment . But the return rate is also high .
And above all delivery will no longer be a headache . Once you have them installed in your factory .
You're certainly right but where can I find the money to buy the new machine .
As China does not make such machines . I have to find hard currency to import them .
Well , can you apply for a hard currency loan from your government or a bank .
I am not sur .
I'm afraid . In China , it will be very difficult , if not entirely impossible .
But something must be done . Otherwise .
I realized the problem a long time ago and have considered various options .
The one which often comes to my mind recently is compensation trad .
I've heard about it .
I need your help . If it is to succeed .
I'd be glad if I can be of any assistance . But I don't see how I can help .
You can supply us with machines and we'll compensate you with garments .
Sounds good , but I wish we made those machine .
What I mean is you buy the machines for us and we'll give you garments as compensation .
Oh I see .
Well , it certainly sounds like a good idea to get around the hard currency problem but there must be a lot of technical details . I'm not clear about .
I've never done such trade before you know .
Neither have I .
But it seems to be the only solution we can think of at the momen .
And if it works out . You don't have to worry about our delivery any mor .
I know it will do both of us . Good .
Therefore I suggest that both of us give it serious consideration after this meeting .
At the moment all we have to do is perhaps write a letter of intent .
Good . What will it say .
Something like this .
In order to further their business relationship , both Dafa garments and Wilshire fashion have expressed their interest in exploring the possibility of compensation trade .
Before visiting the factories . I'm afraid I'll have no ideas which of those machines . We'll need to say nothing of the total payment .
You are certainly righ .
Well , I wouldn't worry at all if the total payment is small .
But what if it amounts to say $400,000 .
Don't worry , we'll compensate you for whatever we owe yo .
I'm afraid you've missed the point .
Further , assume that each quarter we buy from you only $200,000 worth of garment .
That means it will take 6 months for you to complete the compensation .
If I understand it correctly , you are worried about the interest .
Don't worry that will be included in the compensation .
I'm not worried about that .
What I'm really concerned about is the length of the compensation .
It's quite similar to a credit repayment .
Credit providers all like to see their credits repaid as soon as possible because the longer the repayment is the riskier it will becom .
I see what you mea .
But then , why don't you buy more from us .
That'll speed up the compensation .
I hope I can but there are a lot of uncertainties .
What if the economy does not recover in next 6 months .
Some analysts even say people will spend less on clothing because the recession will get worse .
But there are many analysts predicting otherwis .
That's True nobody can be 100% certain . And this is why I can't say we will definitely buy more from you , although I wish to do so .
How old is this factory Mr. Moro .
Almost 10 years old .
How is the busines .
Pretty good .
Then why do you want to sell your machines .
I want to sell the old machines only .
They are Obsolete require too much labor .
Could you show them to us .
Come this way .
There are 2 cutting machine .
Over there , towards the far end of the wall are 10 Hemming machines .
On their right are 35 sewing machines .
Is that all .
No .
Down the aisle in the connecting room as I'll show you very soon . We have 4 steam pressing machine .
How long have these machines been in use .
3 to 5 years .
Are they all worn out .
Oh no .
Most of them are still in perfect shape just need a lot of people to attend t .
Could you give us dem .
Sure thing .
Sophia come here and show our guests how good our machines are .
Mr. Li which factory . Do you like most .
Well , it's hard to say .
The machines at the Ralph's would be a real bargain if we insist on our bi .
But they are not much more advanced than our own in Chin .
What about those in the last factory .
I'm afraid they have the same problem .
Well , that leaves Ho's clothing only .
His machines are really good , but the prices are hig .
Only if we can buy them at the 3-fifths of the invoice value .
I think you can make it .
You're kidding me .
I'm no .
An insider told me that the real reason for Mr. to sell the machines is not that the profit is too small .
He is up to his ears in debt he desperately wants to liquidate his fixed assets to pay the debts .
So if we play tough he'll sell his machines at my bid price .
Few , if any , people in the States would buy garment machines in such an economic recession . So we may probably have the machines at an even lower price .
I'll give Mr. a ring when I'm back in my office . He must be waiting for our response .
Thank you very much . Mr. Li .
If I ever invest in China . I'll ask you to be my consultant .
My pleasure . But you have to pay me $1,000 per hour .
You deserve more . Mr. L .
I'll give you 1 million per hour .
Well Mr. Taylor Mr. Bowen said you have friends all over the country .
Do you know someone who'd like to invest in garments industry in China .
Well , let me think . Right . This might be the person you are looking for .
Come this way .
Alan , I think you might be interested in meeting Mr. Li .
Alan Bush of Santana Apparel Kang Li of Dafa garments .
And if you'll excuse me , I'd like to talk to that pretty lady over there .
Thank you Mr. Taylo .
A very interesting argument , but I guess you're right .
Now Mr. Li could you tell me how profits and risks are shared in such a ventur .
It depends on which form the joint venture takes .
Basically there are 2 types of joint venture equity joint venture and contractual joint venture .
What's the difference .
In an equity joint venture the profits and risks are shared . According to the partners' shares of equity in that venture .
The bigger the share , the greater the profits and risks the partner will have .
That's fair .
Then how are the profits and risks shared in the other type of joint venture .
In a contractual joint venture everything is stipulated in a contract , so is the proportion of profits each partner is entitled t .
I see then which type of joint venture from a foreign investor's point of view is better .
Both have pluses and minuses .
An equity joint venture has better legal protection because it's an independent legal person .
And because of this . The government gives such joint ventures more favorable policies in financing and taxatio .
What are the disadvantages .
The business risks are greater .
If the venture does not run well the foreign investor may lose everything he has invested .
Is a contractual joint venture safer .
In some aspects . Ye .
For instance , even if the venture is running at loss the foreign investor may still get some of his investment back through depreciation of his machinery if the contract so stipulates .
Then what are the disadvantages for such ventures .
The major disadvantage is that the legal protection for them is not as complete as for equity joint ventures because a contractual joint venture may or may not be an independent legal person .
Frankly speaking , I think the price is working against u .
Why . Mr. John . This is a fair market price .
It certainly is .
What leads you to think that we have to reduce our price .
Tell me candidly . Mr. John .
I look at it this way : suppliers should be able to reduce their CIF price even lower than their home price .
We give you quotations on the same basis as we quote in the domestic marke .
That's the point .
Your overhead is in your domestic price , but it can't be carried in the CIF price .
But even with the overhead out the export over head must be put in . Finally . It comes to the same thing .
Anyway , I'll look into it .
I wish you could because there's plenty of other business offerings here .
I've brought some sample materials . With me today , Mr. Johnson .
Good .
Can I look at the .
Please do .
I'd like to have your comments on some of these pieces .
You seem to have a little of everything HERE rayon nylon cotton tetolon .

Yes . Bush jacket children's school uniforms and so on .
The rayon would be just the thing I think .
And this piece to .
That's one of the fibers , isn't it .
This piece .
There's some cotton in THIS : It looks like mixed staple and cotto .
Soft to the touch . Isn't it .
Yes , that's one of its good points .
Would you like to visit our factorie .
Yes , that would be GOOD I can get the first hand information .
I'll make the arrangemen .
I hope you have a better understanding of our products and our company .
I hope so too .

I'll call on you again maybe next month .
Goodbye .
It's very attractive copier what's the power .
Oh I see it's given here 100V AC 20-amperes .
The actual printing is done by a mercury quartz tub .
Did you say it gives dry copies .
Yes .
Do you have any shipping details .
For example , size-weight etc .
The shipping weight of this one is approximately 70kg .
Is it .
That's about 150 pounds a little more , perhaps .
Shall I get some literature together for you .
I wish you would .
I'm sure we can do something with this model .
Can you give me a rough idea of the price .
Prices to you would have to be worked out either FOB or CIF price .
What you see here ranges from 850 US dollars to 1,200 US dollars ex factor .
I see .
Hello , Mr. Dean visiting again , are you .
Yes , calling on some of our distributor .
What's new in the dinnerware line .
We're offering smaller sets and putting on more patterns in open stock .
What's the trend in styling recently .
We've found a fairly lively demand for fluted bodies .
Can you take any .
I imagine we ca .
What minimum runs , do you want for new shapes .
We're aiming at 5,000 set minimums per new pattern .
Can't you bring it down to 3000 sets .
Quicker sales , you kno .
We can consider it .
When do you want this delivery .
The sooner the better .
Well , I'll have something ready for you such as quotations catalogs and samples in a week or so .
Thank you . You are always considerate .
I'd like you to look through this new set of drawings , if you please .
Certainly .
They're blueprints of the gauges you wrote us about .
That's right .
Shall we go through the drawings togethe .
Well , briefly .
Then I'll be in again to discuss manufacturing details price and delivery with yo .
Do you have any particulars about the specifications .
No . I'll bring them next time .
Let's take this print firs .
Yes .
This is a mini-type generator no outside connection .
It's very convenient .
We can work on the 2 ways portable and fixed , isn't i .
Yes , our draftsmen will prepare layouts for you and work out an estimate for both types .
That's just what I want . Let me have the information as soon as you can .
And the specifications .
Oh yes I'll bring them tomorrow morning .
Mr. Matthews , I'll give you this schedule .
This sheet covers the items we're likely to want about 2 months from now .
Thank you .
Orders will be placed . Later , I suppos .
That's right .
Now , I think you could help us to widen our market if you'd let us have more descriptive literatur .
What kind of literature . Exactl .
Leaflets or booklets .
Booklets preferabl .
Something up to say 20 pages or so illustrating microscope models suitable for use in college laboratories .
Doesn't our present range of leaflets cover such models .
It does but only up to a point .
We would like to have more cuts and photos of specimen enlargements .
You know , the usual section cut giving the magnification .
The microscope model on one page and Representative subject enlargements on the facing page Is that what you mean .
Exactly .
Perhaps we could arrange something for you Do you have any particular subjects in mind .
I mean , study , or research subjects biology metallurgy .
Oh the usual subjects in a college curriculum .
We're going to approach schools research laboratories and institutions of that kind .
We have an excellent line of microscope sets that would be suitable .
They include a range of interchangeable lenses and small accessories .
Yes . But they have a rather elaborate case .
I don't think schools taking say 100 or even 50 microscopes would want the same number of cases in which to keep the .
Possibly not .
But there would have to be some means of storing the lenses .
Yes , I agree .
I was thinking that you could supply wooden boxes to hold the lenses and the accessories .
6 to 8 lenses in the SET , would that be about the number .
Well what magnification would you recommend .
What range , I mean .
For college courses . I'd recommend magnification ranging from 100 to 1200 . You could get that in suitable steps with 8 lenses .
The technical part we'll leave to YOU inquiries we've had are promising .
Have you an approximate invoicing price in mind .
I should say a typical set could be invoiced to the buyer for around $80 .
By shipping in quantities we could manage that .
Anyway , we'll try .
Thank you .
I have a lot of new sketches ready for you Mr. Wilso .
Fine , thank you .
I'd like to have a look at them .
Certainly .
I've got about 20 of them right here in this room and many others in the artists room . Let's start with those I've got here .
Okay .
Here you are .
What do you think of this one .
Not bad .
But I think it would look better if this group of flowers were reduced say 20% .
I see , I'll note it down .
Well what about the next one .
Oh this is quite similar to what I bought just a week ago .
Is it really .
I wish I could have shown ours to you 2 weeks earlier .
You may be right , Mr. Chang .
Now show me what you've got . Nex .
Here you are .
This IS interesting . I like the design but the colors are a bit too heavy .
Are the .
We can make them lighter if you like .
Fine .
Now tell me , Mr. Chang , how long will it take to get the design re-colored .
Just give me a couple of days .
All righ .
It'll look very nice if the colors are made softe .
I'm sure it will .
Shall I send it to your hotel as soon as it's read .
Oh , that's very kind of you .
Now let's see the next .
Yes . Here it i .
How do you like i .
This is the last one of the 20 What do you think of our sketches generally .
The designs are GOOD I'll probably take up several if the change in colors turns out satisfactory .
I'm glad to hear THAT and I'm sure our artists will do a good job .
By the way . Mr. Wilson , do you have an estimate about the trend in fashions .
Well , that's a very difficult question to answer .
You know I am always looking for something ne .
Personally I think the next fashion might be something warm in color .
Oh I see .
For instance the color in this sketch .
Yes , but it's only my guess .
Thank you Mr. Wilson . It's good advic .
I believe you know that we are going to take 2 or 3 of our tankers off the Persian Gulf run either this year or next .
Yes you did send us some correspondence about tha .
That's right we did .
Well , we're now able to go further into the question of replacement .
You haven't submitted any preliminary tenders , have you .
Not yet , but we gathered from your last letter that you intended to get bids from u .
Yes .
There was some doubt about size of The Replacements . However , we've decided to go ahead with 2 ships in the 20 to 30 thousand-ton class .
I see .
Then , would you like us to draw up general plans and specification .
Yes , we would .
And for the purpose of bidding you can quote for a 24,000 and a 26,000 that's dead weight tonnage in both cases .
I se .
And the propulsion method whether steam or diesel you'll leave to us , I suppose .
Yes .
Is there any distinct advantage in having one or the other .
Well , there are many factors to be taken into consideration in deciding which type you want .
Which is the cheaper to run the diesel or the steam .
Diesel is the more economical in fuel on a pound per horse power basis .
And it's lighter .
But diesel fuel is more expensive , surely .
It is , and that might offset the saving in fuel .
Now comes the question of price .
Can you indicate what budget you are prepared to allocate for the vessels .
I can tell you that we are willing to go up to $180 per ton , but terms of payment must be considered together with the pric .
Well , we can proceed on the basis of $180 .
Shall we submit our tender to your Hong Kong office .
Yes . Either direct or through your representative in Hong Kong .
Who is your representative in Hong Kong now .
You have a new man there I believe .
Yes , Mr. Kenneths .
I know your former representative Mr. Parkson very well . We often met in the street .
Did yo .
Mr. Kenneths will be there for 2 years .
Is that so .
I'll call him when I am back in Hong Kong .
Hello , Mr. Smith , Mr. Thompson .
I trust you've had a good rest .
Yes , thank you .

Why not .
No better time than now .
I understand that Mr. Watson of your party has not arrived ye .
When do you expect hi .
He has booked his flight for the 14t .
I think we can draw up a tentative plan no .
If Mr. Watson , wants to make any changes . Minor alterations can be made then will that suit you .
Fine .
Well Smith . I'm sure Mr. Watson wouldn't mind a day of sightseeing as our hosts have taken all the trouble to arrange things .
Well in that case .
Mr. Lin . Were you thinking of any particular place you wanted How about it Smith .
Well , we had the Summer Palace in mind .
The summer residence of the Empress Dowager .
That would be nice . We've heard so much about it .
How about it Smit .
Sure . I'm all for it . Now that you've got me interested , but is there any way of ensuring we'll have enough time for our talk .
Well , so long as we know what each other's requirements are , and we don't get bogged down on details . I'm sure the talks will progress as planned .
Well , for our part , we'll do our best to make everything smooth sailing .
Thank you . If all goes well , we'll be able to wind up our talks , the day after tomorrow .
I hope so anyway . We'll do our best .

Quite righ .
That's the aim of our corporation . And meanwhile , my most important mission .
Since China has pursued the socialist market economy its foreign trade has been developing at a faster Pace our trade practice is more flexible than before .
I'm sure you know all this righ .
Yes I DO . I am very much interested in the new developments in China .
I've heard that your company is prepared to call for a bid for a power engineering construction project in southeast China , is that true .
Yes , it is time to make arrangements . Now for the invitation to be sent out .

Mr. Tang I've asked too much today . I'm afrai .
That's all right .
You may contact Mr. Wu Changbiao , our staff member for further detail or talk to me directly if you like .
Fine .
Thank you very much .
Let's keep close touch with each other now and in the futur .
Yesterday , we paid a visit to the Imperial palace , it's really amazing that the Chinese people have built such a great ancient palace its architectural art is fantastic .
The Imperial Palace is also called forbidden city its construction was begun in 142 .
Since then , 24 ancient Chinese emperors had lived there .
During the Ming and Qing Dynasties many magnificent structures were built and perfected . Therefore it deserves the title the excellent fruit of Chinese traditional architectural art .
Yes . It surely deserves the praise .
Especially when I see the delicate designs engraved on the woodwork of the Palace , which has undergone several hundreds of years . I'm thinking of joining hands with you to set up a wood plastic sheeting processing plant which would furnish China with the finest plastic sheetings used for the interior decoration .
It sounds a good idea .
Besides , it coincides with our aspiration .
There is no doubt that we will make concerted efforts to cooperate with you .
Investors may enjoy preferential treatment for the establishment of a joint venture in Chin .
Oh .
What preferential treatment . Can we get for a Sino foreign joint venture .
According to the related laws and regulations of the Chinese government the preferential treatment provided to the investors is relatively attractive as compared with that of other Asian countries .
First of all , a joint venture in China pays lower income tax or even no income tax at all . Under certain conditions during first 5 profit making years .
The way I understand the profit making year you mentioned is different from the year in which the plant is in operation , right .
You are right .
What I mean is the year when the plant gets profits .
That's what I have thought .
Furthermore , you are allowed to remit your net profit after having paid taxes to your home countries and the part of the income tax on your net profit you paid already to the Chinese government will be exempted from taxation at home as long as you have met the relative requirements .
That is the avoidance of double taxation .
It's encouraging anyhow . This is the first time for us to invest in China . We'd like to be absolutely sure about our investment .
What concerns me is how long the advantage of paying lower tax would last .
Please Don't Worry About It : the Chinese policy of opening to the outside world will remain stable for a long period for it has been incorporated into the Chinese constitution .
Thus I can rest assured of i .
China's political situation is stable and the policy of opening up is firm our country now provides an excellent investment environment .
Specifically speaking , China is a big country with a large population rich resource and a comparatively low level of wages and material cost . All these are apparently favorable conditions for direct investment .
China also needs to import advanced equipment and technology so as to improve the product quality production efficiency .
And the Chinese party usually brings in land building labor and funds in renminbi . The Chinese currency . So compared with a wholly foreign-owned company , a joint venture imposes a much smaller financial burden on the foreign investor .
So we have vast potentials for cooperation between us .
I'd like to know how profits and risks are shared in the joint venture .
It depends upon which form the joint venture take .
Basically there are 2 types of joint venture equity joint venture and contractual joint ventur .
What's the difference between the .
In an equity joint venture the profits and risks are shared . According to the partners' shares of equity in that venture .
The bigger the share , the greater the profits and risks the partner will hav .
Then how are the profits and risks shared in the contractual joint venture .
In a contractual joint venture everything is stipulated in a contract , so is the proportion of profits each partner is entitled t .
I see .
Could you tell me the details about establishing and running a joint venture .
What do you mean .
For instance , is there any regulation regarding the foreign party's share in the registered capital .
The relative regulations are rather flexible Generally speaking in a joint venture , the proportion of investment by the foreign investors should not be less than 25% , but there isn't an upper limit .
Thanks .
How long is the duration of a joint ventur .
No rigid rules either .
We may temporarily set a 15 year period for a joint venture , like the wood plastic sheeting processing plant .
The contract could be extended . If both sides agree so long as we can run the plant well .
How should we decide the administrative responsibilities of a joint venture .
The joint venture will be run under the guidance of the board of directors , according to the relevant regulations and laws : The number of directors as well as rights and responsibilities representing a party should be determined on the basis of the investment that particular party has made in the business .
It sounds rather reasonabl .
Managing directors and managers will be nominated and agreed upon by both parties through consultation .
Their term of office is 4 years they could be dismissed and replaced if any one of them is proved to be unqualified .
Thank you very much .
You have certainly enlightened me quite a lot about establishing a joint venture in China .
I'll bring this matter up and hold a discussion with my company's management on the joint venture proposition as soon as I return hom .
I'll let you know directly when we have something fir .
I shall look forward to hearing from you soon .
Good .
I hope that through our joint efforts you will go back home with a new contract . Just as you did in all yours .
So do I .
Terrific .
Now let's get down to business .
Your fax of June 2nd says you want to buy blouses from u .
That's correc .
Here are the designs .
Thank you .
We certainly welcome this opportunity to further our relationship .
Now how shall we proceed .
We're here at your disposal .
Well , as we both have expressed satisfaction at our previous contract may I suggest that it be the basis of the new contract .
This will simplify the matter a great deal .
That might be a good idea , but the market situation has somewhat changed since we signed the previous contract last July .
At that time , the US economy was not as bad as it is today and people still had a lot of discretionary money to spend .
According to the latest forecast by the US Consumer Association . However , the recession will get worse before the economy gets bette .
As a result , the US consumers will remain tight-fisted if the price stays on the same level .
Your point is well taken . Mr. Bowen and people will spend less when their wallets get flatter .
But that applies mostly to luxurious items such as cars and fashion .
What you want to buy from us are blouses , a common necessity just like Food as we all know goods of necessity are inelastic .
In other words , whatever the prices , people will just have to buy them .
Well put . Mr. Li as far as the theory is concerne .
But I'm afraid . The price of blouses is not entirely inelastic .
Too high a price will certainly force people to buy fewer blouses , particularly in a recession like this .
But the price of our blouses is never too high .
As a matter of fact they are the most competitive in your market .
Well , what should I say .
I only hope they will remain competitive and affordable to our customers .
That's for sure .
I've told you that we were already in a tight corner and couldn't move . Any more .
Look , Mr. Bowen . If we had thought of our own interest only , we wouldn't have accepted the terms of payment you propose .
Right .
Yes .
We took the risk . Nevertheless , because we felt that our relationship can't develop without mutual understanding and mutual concessions .
So I hope you will treat this price issue in the same spirit .
All right .
Let me make it $14.9 .
Frankly , I doubt if we can make any profit at this price .
Mr. Bowen you needn't be so Pessimistic . Even at $15.90 . You can still make reasonable profit .
You must be kidding M Li .
I'm serious dollars 1590 That's my rock bottom . PRICE I can't sell our blouses under their real value .
$14.90 I can't go any furthe .
Well , don't you think it's time for a break .
Right .
We all need a good stretch .
What do you say to their suggestion Mr. Bowe .
I'm afraid they are righ .
Let's take a break .
Well , what should we do .
I really can't commit myself if the total payment for the machinery is too big .
But before we see the factories , how can we know how much the total payment is .
Perhaps we should go to the factories first .
No , I'd rather go there with a definite idea about the financial arrangement .
I don't want to waste my time bargaining without knowing where the money will come from .
All right . I've got an idea .
Yes .
Let's set an upper limit for the financing , you're going to provid .
And Dafa garments will take care of the balance if the total payment exceeds that limit .
What do you say to that .
That seems to be a reasonable ide .
Let me see what about $200,000 .
I'm afraid we need more than that .
At least $300,000 .
Remember , you have to pay interest for that .
I know .
All right . $300,000 .
Thank you very much , Mr. Bowen .
I hope we won't have to spend all of it .
So do I .
Well , shall we take a break .
I could do with a cup of coffee . What would you like coffee or tea .
Tea , please .
In front of you is the draft for the formal agreement on the compensation trade package .
It is based on my contract with Ho's clothing and our agreement on the financial arrangement .
Would you please read it over first .
Thank you Mr. Bowen .
It's a very good draft on the whole , that is .
Thank you . But if you have any questions or want to make any change in the wording and phrasing please feel free to let me know .
I wil .
In fact , I do have a couple of points I'd like to discuss with yo .
Good fire away .
First of all , the financial arrangement .
Perhaps you still remember the counter guarantee I proposed last Wednesda .
Yes , you asked me to guarantee that by the time your usance L C is due the accumulative value of our purchase from you should be the same as the value of your L C .
That's righ .
But all I can promise at the moment is that we'll do our best in purchasing from you .
That's not a guarantee .
But what else can I d .
Have you come up with a more practical idea .
Ye .
Earlier , you asked me to open a 180-day usance L C righ .
Yes .
Well , if you'll excuse me , I'd like to refill my glass .
See you later . Mr. Bowen .
Mr. Taylor as a Brewer , you must be an expert in win .
Well , sort of .
Are you interested in exporting your wine to China .
Sure . I am .
That's why I'm here .
To be frank with you . I'm not very familiar with your countr .
Is there a big market in China for imported win .
Yes , and with their bulging wallets . The number of companies selling foreign wine is also on the rise .
That's excitin .
But I still don't know how to go about exporting to China .
You may begin with any Chinese importer who's interested in buying your wine .
This consulate has directories of Chinese companies doing international busines .
Oh , I also have a friend in Shanghai selling foreign wine .
This is his name and address .
Thank you . I'll get in contact with him right away .
After you find someone who's interested in importing your wine . You can then work out the detail .
At first you may work on an ad hoc basi .
As you become familiar with each other . You may proceed to an exclusive sales or agency arrangement .
How do you d .
How do you do .
Nice to meet you Mr. Smith .
I am Liu Meimei from the marketing department .
Here is my card .
Liu Meimei .
Am I right .
Excellen .
Have a seat . Please .
Thank you .
What do you like to drink coffee , tea or Cola .
Tea would be fine . Chinese tea is my favorit .
Miss Liu . You must have heard of our company , we are one of the leading tea importers in Britain .
Yes .
We have received your illustrated PR brochure .
I note that our Chinese tea is popular in your market .
That is right . We are very interested in your tea products .
Here is our latest catalog and samples . Please have a loo .
Thank yo .
Black tea and Longjin tea are sellable in our marke .
Well , we have developed some new varieties of tea such as rolled strips and curl black tea crushed black tea and so on .
They all enjoy a very sound market in Western Europe and North America .
How about your supply position .
Well all articles displayed here are available .
That is very good .
I am particularly interested in your oolong tea of Fujian origin and Jasmine tea of Jiangsu origin .
Is it possible for you to give me concrete quantity of the above item .
Okay .
I'd like to make a trial sale of the 2 . I want to order 5 0-0 kilograms of oolong tea of Fujian origin and Jasmine tea of Jiangsu origin respectively .
Thank you very muc .
It is very clear .
As this is trial order I hope you'll allow me special consideratio .
Can you grant me any commission .
Well , as a rule . We do not do business on commission basis .
But since it is an initial business between us we could give you 2% commission .
Thank you .
I'd live to have your lowest quotation CIF London .
Here are our FOB and Cif prices .
All the prices in the catalog are subject to our final confirmatio .
By the way , do you have any specific requirements for the delivery time .
That's what I'm going to talk abou .
We need shipment in September or in October .
Good .
We'll let you have our offer tomorrow .
Fine . I'll be waiting for your offer .
Well begun is half done .
See you tomorrow morning at 9 .
See you tomorrow .
Mr. Masen in honor of your second visit . I'd like to invite you to have Shuan Yangrou at Dong Lai Shun Restaurant this evening . You know it is instant boiled mutton .
Thank you .
Shan Yangrou of Dong Lai Shun is world-renowned I know .
You are very kind to invite me to a dinner party .
But I have a headache at the thought of eating Mutton .
Why .
I say a headache because the prospects for importing mutton from China are not so Encouraging we are short of foreign exchange this yea .
Oh what a pity .
Please don't be worried about it .
As I see it . Egypt is a big market for the export of our beef and mutton apparently it would also be a loss for us , if you don't import mutton and beef we might be able to work out a solution .
Yes . The purpose of my present visit here is to solve this problem .
Could you accept barter trad .
Yes . We'll see what we can do .
But what commodity , do you have to exchange for our beef and mutton .
What about cotton .
China used to import large quantities of cotton from Egypt every year is it acceptable for us to sell cotton as payment for your beef and mutto .
Oh my dear friend . Please don't forget that we are both dealers in foodstuffs .
It doesn't matter to us .
We deal in a great variety of items .
What about you .
But we have never imported cotton before .
We need to consult the other department of our corporation . If you decide to barter with cotton .
Please do that as soon as possible .
I tell you the total import of beef and mutton roughly would equal your purchase of cotton , though the import and export trade will be carried out separately .
Anyhow , it's relatively difficult to do business in this manner .
We're not sure whether we could simultaneously sign 2 contracts that is one sales contract for beef and mutton and the other contract of equal value for the purchase of cotton .
I do not mean the same day by simultaneously .
The time limitation may not be so strict . I think it is quite all right so far as it's within one month or  .
That means import and export can be done . Separately , one may be earlier or later than the other by one or 2 months .
Precisely .
How would both parties open their letters of credit .
The letters of credit could be opened against Each Other : It's also possible that one could be opened before or after the other .
If one L C should be opened before the other is the party who first opens the L C taking some risks .
There's no risk at all . He who opens L C first may state in his L C that the said L C comes into force only when an L C with approximately the same value from the counterparty is established with a tolerance of plus or minus 5% .
I see that arrangement ensures the obligation of the other party to buy .
Anyhow . You may rest assured that we'll not go back on our words .
I do believe that you will carry out your promise .
This arrangement helps implement the principle of equality and mutual benefit and exchange of needed goods .
Yes , that is true .
The problem of your shortage of foreign exchange can be resolved . While the urgent requirements of both sides can be met .
Let me contact them right NoW I'll ask them to consider our proposition of barter trade .
In a day or 2 . I'll call you up to meet again here and finalize the transaction .
Last time we were talking about the establishment of a joint venture to produce the wooden plastic sheeting through consultation with my company , we'd like to establish an equity joint venture .
Each of the 2 sides will put in a certain portion of the capital and share profits or losses in proportion to their respective contribution .
A good idea , it coincides with my aspiration .
How much of a financial outlay is needed .
About 5 million US dollars including loans .
How much would you like to invest in this project anyway .
As the general practice we lay out about 51% of the total Investment This includes land building labor and funds in renminbi . The Chinese currency .
What regulations does Chinese government have on the foreign proportion of investmen .
The foreign investment proportion shall be no less than 25% .
Then our capital contribution will include production equipment testing instruments and technolog .
At the beginning we may import one set of production line we can expand it later in time .
Very good . Now let's talk about the duration of the joint ventur .
How long can we run it .
Let's set it for 20 years for the time being .
The contract could be extended . If both sides agree .
That's fine . There's also another question of the composition of the board of director .
Usually its composition will be in proportion to the capital contributed .
What about the term of office of the director .
As usual , it's set for a 4-year term .
We are working on the feasibility study now .
It'll be sent to you directly when it's finished .
All righ .
Super a home away from home . As the saying goe .
I'm glad you like i .
Well , if you don't mind . I'd like to discuss the itinerary with you .
Not at all .
Good .
Here are some copies of the tentative itinerary we drafted for YOU . Let's go over it . Please feel free to make changes . Wherever you feel necessary .
Okay .
You'll stay in China for 6 days , the first 4 days in Beijing and the rest in Guangzhou .
Good .
As you need a day or 2 to get over jetlag you'll have a light schedule for today and tomorrow .
In fact , nothing is fixed up for you this afternoon .
You could either stay in the hotel for a good rest or go out for sightseeing which do you prefer .
If you want to go sightseeing . I'd be glad to be your guide .
I'd like to go out , but someone wants to interview me during our visi .
Here is his card .
Wang Dawei Correspondent China Daily .
Right I met this Mr. Wang last month in Washington , DC .
He was interested in our business with China and wanted to write a report on it .
I take this as an excellent opportunity to publicize our corporation .
So , I'd appreciate it very much . If you would help me arrange this interview .
Mr. Wang's address and phone number are on his card , aren't they .
Yes .
I'll call him as soon as we finalize the itinerar .
Thank you , Mr. Yang .
Mr. Bowen , did you have a good time yesterday .
Oh yes .
We got on the Tiananmen Gate and had a great time up there .
Good .
How about you Mr. Dewey .
Have you enjoyed your first visit to China .
Oh yes .
I've enjoyed every minute . And everything of IT the Tiananmen Gate the Forbidden City the Chinese food and the Beijing Opera everythin .
I'm glad you both have had a good time .
But have you got anything to complain about .
No .
It couldn't be better .
Well I've got only one thing to complain abou .
That is , we're a bit spoiled by your hospitality , I'm afraid .
Honestly , we've got nothing to complain about .
Very goo .
Have you both got over the jet lag .
Thanks to your thoughtful arrangement . I feel much better now .
Me to .
I'm glad to hear tha .
Well since you both have had a good time and no longer suffer from the jet lag . Maybe it's time to talk business now .
I think so .
Good afternoon , Mr. Bowe .
I've got good news for you .
Yes .
We agree to accept the terms of payment you proposed this mornin .
Thank you so much . Mr. Li .
We accept your proposal with an eye on our future relationship . We believe that our relationship cannot last long without mutual understanding and mutual concessions .
I couldn't agree mor .
We've reached an agreement on payment in this spirit .
I hope this spirit will guide us in solving all the other problems .
So do I .
Very good .
Well , speaking of other problems . Maybe it's time to go back to the issue of price .
Okay .
Perhaps we need a quick review of what we've gone through so far .
Our offer was $16.80 each blouse and you counteroffered dollars 1440 We .
I'm sorry , but our first counteroffer was $13.50 the price we paid for the Filipino blouses .
Well if that was your first counteroffer then you increased it to $14.40 .
That's a 7% increas .
Okay .
Then we responded by cutting our offer also by 90 cents and made it $15.90 .
So the next step . Naturally , should be taken by you .
Hello Mr. Wells .
Visiting again , are yo .
Yes , calling on some of our distributors .
What's new in the dinnerware line .
What's the trend in styling recently .
We've found a fairly lively demand for fluted Bodies Can you take any .
I imagine we can .
What minimum runs , do you want for new shape .
Can't you bring it down to 3000 sets .
We can consider IT When do you want this delivery .
The sooner the better .
Well , I'll have something ready for you such as quotations catalogs and samples in a week or so .
Thank you . You are always considerate .
I thought you were more interested in synthetic fiber .
Yes . But I'm also interested in your cotton blend .
Some of them , especially the ones made for export are copied from some 17th century lace articles made for Louis XIV of France .
Really . I didn't notice them in the catalog . You gave me .
Here's the same one you've got and here are some pictures .
Look at this graceful cloth it goes very well with a Candle Light Dinner .
Yes , it looks like it does .
And yet this cloth gives the most practical service .
Between launderings spots come right out with a sponge .
And it's so easy to wash .
How .
Simply dip it in suds rinse and allow it to drip dry .
Of course it dries quickly and smoothly , without a wrinkle .
How did you find that last lot of marmalad .
Oh . Excellent .
But one or 2 buyers said the marmalade might be little too sweet .
I see .
And the canned peaches what about them .
That's a different story .
The taste of The Peaches is FINE . But as you know appearance counts in canned food .
Without any doubt appearance comes before pric .
How could the canned peaches be improved .
I recommend a pleasant color and no mess .
Where's the mess . Exactly .
In the syrup or in the peach halves .
Customers have told me that the hollow of the peach halves . You know the inside of the peach should be clean cut that is to say no fibers or pulp remainin .
We're in the market for machine tools , what can you offer in this line .
What types . Do you have in mind . Exactly .
Well , mainly lathe we're also interested in shapers grinders and milling machines .
Let me show you some illustrations of the machines we mad .
Here's our latest catalog .
<EMPTY .
These are the machines , we're interested i .
Look the specifications are at the bottom of the pag .
Pretty sturdy machines , I should say .
Is your showroom far from here .
No , it's only a 20 minute car ride .
Are you free now .
I will be free tomorrow afternoon .
Suppose we make it say 2 o'clock tomorrow Afternoon Could you manage that .
Yes , I'll pick you up at your hotel .
Do you find competition severe these days .
It's more severe than it was say this time last year .
In what way .
Price advertisin .
Well some of the newcomers have put on attractive exhibitions in various cities throughout the country that gives them a sudden spurt in sales .
You're expanding your plant I hear .
Yes .
Our new factory will start production sometime towards the end of this month . That'll help with deliveries .
Really .
I hope you'll open another one after that .
Thanks .
Sales are going up year by YEAR We'll have to expand to keep up with demand .
The next step might be opening a factory abroad .
Well that's possible .
We've been considering that .
Then your delivery problems will fade out .
When is the straight bill of lading used .
That's used only when goods are sold on open account or shipped on consignment . But it's very rare no .
How does an exporter create an order bill of ladin .
He'll do that by consigning the goods to his own order or to the order of a bank .
Then the title to the goods is vested in the exporter to whose order the bill of lading is drawn .
That's right . And the importer can't get possession of the goods without producing a copy of the bill of lading properly endorsed by the consignee .
What are the differences between the importer and the consignee .
Well , you could see the name of the importer written on straight bills of lading but order bills of lading carry the name of the exporter or a bank as the consigne .
Tell me the difference between documentary and clean credits pleas .
Well documentary credits are very COMMON they require drafts drawn on them and documents of title to the Cargo clean credits aren't supported by these documents .
Isn't it customary to have invoices and bills of lading made out in triplicat .
Yes , they're usually prepared in sets of 2 or 3 especially when drafts are to be negotiated under documentary credits the issuing bank will expressly require invoices bills of lading and marine insurance policies in triplicate to be disposed of exactly in accordance with the terms of the credit .
Are banker's credit and letter of credit . The same .
Yes , they're practically the same .
A letter of credit is issued on the request of the importer . But usually when credit is established by cable no letter of credit is issued .
Are the expressions of sight draft Time Draft usance and letter of credit adequate terms to express the different methods of paymen .
No these terms need to be amplified .
What if the sale is made on the basis of sight draft .
Then the shipping documents have to be attached .
That way , both parties confirm the documents that will accompany the draft and constitute evidence of shipment in compliance with the contract terms .
We are so used to these words and it's very likely that we're often very brief in contract terminology .
Yes , we must be very careful in building up clear expressions and complete understanding on both sides of trade .
Yes , that is very important .
What can you offer to compete with some of the new models we see on the market . Nowadays .
We've got these lines .
They're much in demand just now , all of them have new feature .
Well your terms , by the way , are they down payment or at sight payment .
We ask that your payment should be by the term of letter of credi .
I see and delivery .
Can you supply fairly promptly .
Yes . Just now we are quoting one month from receipt of orde .
You can't supply from stock then .
In some lines we CAN For example accessories .
I see .
I will go through this folder . When I get back to the hotel .
Before I leave here I shall probably be able to place a modest sized order with you .
Thank you .
We shall be pleased to attend to it .
We would like you to quote a price for delivery FOB .
I'll take care of that .
And you could send us a market report every week with full particulars on price changes is that all right .
Sure , we can do that .
For payment of your invoice . I believe you have no objection to delivery of documents against acceptance on 60 days draft .
For that matter . We have to ask you to agree to our terms of documents against payment .
Well I suppose that's all we can discuss today .
I'll contact my office in New York and call you up as soon as I get information from the .
I'm always in the office in the morning . Goodbye .
See you again .
What kind of document is an invoice .
It's mailed to a buyer by the seller and contains full particulars of the goods sold such as quantity quality price forwarding particulars and terms of paymen .
I know there are several kinds of invoices Can you explain them to me .
All righ .
There are 4 main kinds of foreign invoices . They are Loco invoice FOB invoice CIF invoice and Franco invoice .
The most commonly used are FOB and Cif invoices . Right .
Right .
Loco invoice is one in which the price charged includes only the cost of goods at the warehouse of the seller other expenses are paid by the buyer .
By CIF invoice the price charged includes all the expenses of an FOB invoice plus freight and marine insurance .
All expenses to destination are included in the price in a Franco invoice .
Hello Mr. BLACK you've come at a GOOD time . We've just got our latest products all nicely set out in this new catalog .
Good . I'd like to look through i .
Please take this copy .
You're ordering for the Christmas trade . I suppose .
Yes .
Meanwhile , we'll place an order too .
Thank you .
There's a fine range here in this book .
I'll show you the actual toys of course but suppose we glance through a few pages of the catalog firs .
That's a good idea , I'd like to see your latest models .
Here they are in the first section of the catalog .
Oh yes mechanical toys , they're good sellers at any time .
Trains fork lifts monorails space ships . They've got all the features that will appeal to youngsters .
What is the motion power of the toys on this page .
Mainly clockwork the electrically operated are in the next sectio .
Well , we can take a fairly big supply of clockwork types again this year .
What are these .
Electromechanical toys .
They have dry cell batteries , I suppos .
Yes .
Do you have anything in the remote control lin .
Yes , I'll show you som .
Here all these on this page are activated by a remote control system .
I se .
Fine looking sets . They are too . We will have to take such things , although I'm not too keen on complicated mechanisms .
Is there any particular line or design you would like us to prepare for you .
No .
We're ready to take anything that's new something with a freshness about it .
Do you have any suggestions or comments to make about our doll and animal lines .
Comments .
Let me see .
We've heard parents comment unfavorably about long haired toy animals .
About their becoming easily soiled and unsanitary perhaps .
Yes .
Others want fillings , that won't spill when the animals or dolls get punctured .
Well , rubber and plastics are doing away with fillings , of course .
I suppose so .
By the way how's the letter of credit allocation working out .
Is it sufficient for the shipments you've been making .
Yes .
We draw a supplementary D P draft if necessary .
Your head office suggested that as a means of covering the excess in any shipment .
Mr. Smith : it's true . The complete plant , we intend to buy is not small , but I'm afraid you are too modest , when you say it is beyond the financial capability of your Corp .
Everybody knows that yours is one of the largest and most famous transnational corporations in the world and has more than 30 branches in over 10 Countries . It is nothing to you at all to finance the manufacture of the complete plant , we plan to buy .
But you should understand Mr. Zhang , a branch of the Transnational Corporation does not mean the corporation itself .
Each branch is independent with regard to finance and accounting .
Of course , this does not mean no financial help between the head office and the branches exists .
However , this has to be approved by the highest authority of the transnational corporation . The board of directors .
They can authorize the necessary aid to a branc .
I can understand that the branches of a transnational corporation should be independent in their financing and accounting .
Although all of them are socialist in ownership each branch or unit within the associated enterprise is also independent in finance and responsible for its own financial gain or LOSS . We are well aware that there will be no financial problem at all . If your branch manufactures the complete plant single handedly Besides if necessary . You could still get financial aid from the Head Office . I'm sure that the board of the directors will give favorable consideration to authorizing financial help to your branch when they are told your branch is doing business with China .
Oh , that's true , I think .
But you see , even if our head office gives our branch any financial aid interest has to be paid , just the same . It's like a loan from a commercial bank . So in that case , our own money would be tied up in your plant , while we would have to pay interest to the head office for the money borrowed from them .
Mr. Smith , I would like to remind you that we took into consideration the factor of deferred when we cabled you our acceptance of your final offer That means the present price agreed upon by our 2 parties is a bit higher than that for the normal payment terms .
But we did not expect the payment to be effected after actually receiving the shipment , it's even more unfavorable to us than the D P terms and besides we haven't any banker's guarantee .
As to the guarantee of a bank , we may ask for a guarantee from the Bank Of China Do you have any specific proposal in mind .
Yes .
I propose that payment should be made by instalments . That is after each shipment . We will send you the B L and other necessary documents through our bank and yours . The Bank of China .
As long as the documents are in order . You should effect payment without delay in order to ensure payment . The Bank of China should hand us a written letter to the effect that they will guarantee the payment if the buyer fails to do so .
The Bank of China can either give one letter of guarantee for the whole transaction or give separate letters of guarantee for separate instalments . Either way the letter of guarantee should reach us 2 months before shipment is due , as stipulated in the contract .
I don't intend to make an on-the-spot comment on your proposal .
We should study it first and also consult the Bank of China .
But my preliminary impression is that it looks as if the mode of payment is D P but in fact it is no different from L C Payment except that it changes an L C to a bank's Guarantee , it would be in a way more favorable to the seller because a bank's letter of guarantee gives him the bank's direct assurance for the payment , while an L C is opened by the bank only at the request of the opener and also gives a kind of assurance , but not so Direct , am I right .
You may understand it in that way , but a letter of guarantee won't require you to deposit the money in the bank .
I'm afraid the cost one should pay to my bank for the letter of guarantee would surely be no less than the interest . He can get for the money he is required to deposit in the ban .
We must think it over carefully and make certain calculations regarding your proposal and then give you an answer .
Could you come again , the day after tomorrow .
The day after tomorrow . That'll be friday okay I'll be here again at 10:00 AM .
Alright See You Again .
Is there anything else we need to go ove .
I've got a couple of more things in the new catalog to show you .
Okay .
I think we need a break , though .
Me too .
Let's go out for lunch .
Right .
It's been a long sessio .
Well that just about wraps . The whole thing up .
Yes , it's been a good meeting .
You can say that agai .
We're really glad you could come .
Do you have time for lunch with me .
Sure .
Let's go right now before something else comes u .
Chinese Consulate .
May I speak to Mr. Wang Shan please .
Speaking .
Hi Lao Wang Li Kang here .
Li Kan .
Where in the hell are you .
Here in LA for business .
That's great .
How long are you going to sta .
About a week .
Terrific .
We must talk .
Oh tell YOU what there will be a cocktail party here at the consulate on Monday evening .
You must come .
I'd love to . But what's the party for .
We've invited about 50 American business people who have been doing or are interested in doing business with China .
Sounds like a good opportunity for new business possibilities .
You be .
The party will start at 6:30 .
Come a bit earlier so that we can have a little chat of our own .
A good idea .
Is 6 o'clock a bit too early .
Not at all .
Then see you at 6 o'clock Monday evening .
See you then .
There are some minor details I'd like to mention .
Yes .
We think you'd like to taste some Beijing duck while you're in Beijing .
Oh , that would be great .
Then we'll have dinner together on the evening of the 14th . That is the evening of Mr. Watson's arrival .
And would you be interested in Beijing opera .
I wouldn't mind taking in some Beijing Opera .
Would you Smith .
No . I'd like it .
But I hear it is hard to understand .
Thanks . So our evenings will be quite full then .
Thanks . So our evenings will be quite full then .
Oh no , we'll leave some evenings free , that is if it's all right with you .
Oh , sure . That's what I wanted to suggest , we'd have to compare notes on what we've discussed during the day .
Right , let's see what we can work out .
Is there anything special you'd like to do .
There is , if it can be arranged .
Yes .
We'd like to see a couple of your watch factories .
That can be easily arranged .
Anything else .
But if it is not too much trouble . We would like to talk to some of the technicians . If this is possible .
That could be done when you visit the factories .
Good .
We'll take it then that the day after Mr. Watson arrives , we'll have a briefing session so you'll know what we need and we'll know what you have to OFFER will that do .
Sure , that'll put us both in the picture .
The day after that , should we continue with our talks or would you .
Look , couldn't you arrange a visit to one of your factories on that day .
Then we'd have some idea of what you'll be needing .
I can't say for certain off hand . But I think it can be arranged for Mr. Watson to visit the Beijing watch factory in the afternoon . That is if it's convenient for you .
That's ideal .
Better have something we can get our hands on rather than just spend all our time talking .
And after that we'll continue with our Talks you'll have some first-hand knowledge of the situation by then .
Yes , it'll be easier for us to get down to facts the .
We'll be having talks for a couple of days I believe there're a lot of things to go over .
We thought you might like to see the sights of Beijing between talks .
Thanks . Maybe later .
Let's get business over firs .
Well , we had thought a sightseeing trip between talks would be a welcome diversion .
Business can be combined with pleasure . You know .
Of COURSE , I'd appreciate it if you'll arrange i .
All right then I believe that's settled .
By the way Mr. Lin can you recommend a good restaurant . We'd like to give dinner for you to .
Thank you . When the time comes , I'll ask the interpreter to make the necessary reservations for you .
Thanks .
And would you please see that our plane tickets are booked for Tuesday , the day after we wind up our talks .
Sure .
But wouldn't you like to spend an extra day or 2 in Beijing .
I'm afraid that won't be possible . Much as we'd like to you see we've got to report back to the head office .
Oh I see maybe some other time then .
We're sure we'll be in and out of Beijing pretty often in future .
Then it's all settled .
Thank you for your cooperation .
I'm sure the talks will go well .
We've arranged our schedule without any troubl .
Next , let's get down to business .
As the supply of the metal is quite tigh .
Excuse me I can't follow you .
Could you speak slowly , please .
Of COURSE as the supply of the metal is quite tight . Am I speaking slowly enough .

Would you like me to file a copy of this letter before sending i .

Please bring it to me . Now I have been waiting for some important informatio .

There is some information I need to check .
Here are the documents related to the merger , These are photocopies . But if you would like the originals . I could bring those too .
No , that won't be necessary but I also need some of the correspondence , we've carried on with him .
Here are all the letters we sent to Mr. Dodd from 1982 to present .
Fine , but if I remember correctly , he wrote . All his letters in German .
That is correct . Sir but translations for each are attached .
Yes . Ms Tabuchi , is there something you would like to tell me .

Yes , go ahead .
Have Mr. Nogami watch your desk for you until you get bac .
Ms Koda did you look up those files I requeste .

I don't think it's available .
I'm almost certain that information is filed .
Would you like me to check again under a different heading .
Yes . In fact , I believe I asked you to put it in Mr. Hardy's fil .
Maybe that's why I couldn't find it . All the information on the hardy account is filed under the letter  .
Please keep in mind that I need our quarterly report by 2 o'clock this afternoo .
I've finished writing the report on the word processor and running it through a spelling checker .

Miss Sugishita the regular keyboard operator Mrs. AE is absent today so I want you to type this sales data into the profits spreadsheet on the computer .
Do it like this .
Yes , sir . I see .
Why do all the numbers below the dotted line change each time you put a new number in at the top .
The numbers at the bottom , show the profits calculated from the data at the top .
The net profit figure in this cell is calculated by a formula that subtracts the costs in this cell from the gross profit in this cel .
So then a spreadsheet is like a huge calculation sheet .
The value entered into one cell affects all the other values in cells related to it .
Is that correct .
Yes , that is why you must be very careful when you enter data .

Hello . My name is . Jones . I'm looking for . Mr. Black .
I'm Tom Black How can I help you Miss Jones .
I work for star Communications Limited we sell communications equipment everything from fax machines to mobile phone .
I understand that you own a small business .
Yes I DO I operate an office supply business here in my home .
Mr. Black , do you have to travel around a lot for your business .
Yes I do all my deliveries myself .
Do you have a mobile phone .
Yes , I got one a few MONTHS ago it's really helped me a lot .
Do you have a fax machine .
It's pretty much a business essential nowaday .
I have a fax modem on my Computer I usually use it to receive faxe .
Have you ever considered buying a fax machine .
Most people find it much more convenient to have a separate machine for faxes rather than receiving them on the computer .
Why is that .
With a computer fax modem . You can only receive faxes . As long as the computer is on and it is set up to receive the fax .
A fax machine is always ready to receive faxes . No matter when it is .
Also , it allows you to work on your computer . Uninterruptedly You can't be connected to the internet or on the phone and receive a fax at the same time .
I haven't really had too many problems with that so far .
Do you have a photocopier .
No , it's too expensive to buy a photocopier and I don't have enough space for one .
You can get a fax machine that has a built-in photocopier for a fraction of the price you would pay for just a photocopier .
Plus a fax machine takes up much less space .
I didn't know there was such a thing .
They've become very popular over the last few years , especially with small business owners like you because they save a lot of space .
How much do they cost .
They can run anywhere from about 3,000 to $10,000 for a really good one .
It depends on the quality you need and how much you're willing to spen .
A machine of medium quality that meets the needs of most small businesses would run at around 5,000 or $6,000 .
That's cheaper than I Expected Do you have any models . I could look at .
I don't have an actual fax machine with me , but I do have our catalog .
You can look through it and mark a few that you think you'd lik .
If you want to see how one works you can come in to our shop at 67 Lincoln Street .
Are there a lot of different models to choose from .
If you want , I can point out a few that would probably most closely fit what you are looking for .
Sure , go ahead .
Excuse me , Mr. Smith .
Will you give me a few minute .
Yes . Why .
I'd like you to tell me how to use this new computer .
With pleasur .
Oh Miss Carrie . If you are not too busy . Could you do me a favo .
I'll be glad to .
You know , I've been asked to give a talk on environmental pollutio .
Well I've got most of the information I need , but there are some facts . I'd like to check about the recent statistics in Japan . Could you help me .
Certainly .
What would you like me to do .
I'd like to go to the library . This afternoon , but you know how my Japanese is so I'll need your help .
Could you come along with me for an hour or so .
Certainly .
Good morning . Sir may I help you .
Yes I am Nicole Bryant representative of Great Wall Power Co .
I'd like to see the person in charge of purchasin .
Here's my card .
Well , let me see .
I'll find out who is available .
Mr. Bryant someone representing our purchasing department will be here in just a moment .
Why don't you have a seat over there while you wait .
To be frank with you . Mr. Bryant , I'm afraid . Our business is so poor that I really don't know if we can use what you have to show me .
Well Mr. Wells , that's the reason I'm here to help build up business .
Please let me show you how our product has done just that for other store .
Well , what do you hav .
We specialize in power saws and drills .
We have too many lines of these products alread .
Perhaps but I'm not selling goods that remain on the Shelf I'm selling goods at a larger profit .
What's your price range .
Please look at these pictures .
These saws are from $50 to $70 and these drills are from $10 up to $20 .
Do you have any samples with you .
Here you are .
This is the $50 saw and the $10 drill .
I represent Coca Cola Trading Co . We're interested in importing a complete bottling machine for exhibition and sale in our country .
If satisfactory , we may consider further orders .
Well this unit here on display is a full-scale assembly of our latest machine .
What's your opinion .
Very splendid .
How about patent right .
We have 5 international patents which we are ready to sell .
I can consider it .
Do you have any literature I can take with me .
Yes . Here are some catalogs and brochures .
How about the price list .
Here it is .
Thanks , I'll contact yo .
As I said business is very slow right now and I wonder if you have any room for a reduction in price .
No organization can stay in business . If its operations are based on an insufficient margin of profit .
Of course , but we aren't selling power saws and drills made in Chengdu .
You aren't because you haven't tried ours yet .
I would estimate that you could sell at least 10-20 . Dozens of our saws per month easily .
Sounds excellent .
Let me talk this over with my boss this afternoon and let you know later .
Can I keep this catalog .
By the way , what's the room for mark-up .
Would you rather make 20% and turn them over only once a month or would you rather make a 16% profit and turn your goods over several times a month .
We prefer the larger profit from a bigger turn over .
Certainly .
We're in business to make a profit but this profit comes from both a good mark-up and having a high turn over of stoc .
Right .
Very true .
I guess we could use a 16% mark up as long as the turn over is high .
I think you would find it satisfactor .
A 16% mark up has worked very well for all our customers in the past .
I've come here to discuss a reduction in price .
What seems to be the problem .
Frankly speaking , one of your competitors , has offered us a price 20% lower than yours .
And .
I was asked to get a price reduction from your company .
How much do you think you could bring the price down .
5% at the most .
Even if we double the purchase quantit .
In that case , we might be able to manage 8% .
But if production were to be greatly increased the bulk cost would be cheaper , wouldn't it .
Of course , we'd like to continue using your product .
The quality is good and we're accustomed to it .
We pride ourselves on Quality , that's our best selling point .
We realize that .
The only problem is the price .
We have to ask you for a 10% reduction .
But can you effectively handle the increase in quantity .
You don't have to worry .
We've expanded our distribution network .
We want to double our order .
Did you have a chance to look over the information I gave you Mr. Wrigley .
Yes , I did .
As I said before your level of quality is VERY high . However , I'm afraid I can't accept these price .
I see .
No offense but if you want good quality , you have to pay for i .
That's true .
However , with this line of tennis rackets . You have stiff competition against you .
In what way .
Well , although your competitors' products are not as good as yours , they're cheaper and more attractive . Which will bring in quicker profits in the short term .
Our products have sold very well in the North American market so far .
Uh-huh . But your new rackets are not well known and the look isn't attractive enough so the higher prices may push away customers .
Let me get this straight . You feel that our rackets won't easily attract new customers because of the high price and design .
That's right , though I understand you have a solid line . I have to look for a dependable profit .
I see .
If your order is large . We would offer you a bulk discoun .
I really think it would be better at first for you to sell this new line of rackets at lower price .
I don't think that's feasible . We've already had an unexpected rise in Materials Costs the price isn't very flexibl .
How big an order . Are you thinking of .
Probably around a thousand items to begi .
At the prices you gave me a 15% discount would be good .
Would you consider 10 .
I'll tell you . What : Let me take your samples back to my boss we'll think it over and contact you later .
Okay that sounds fine .
Paula , to be quite frank with you I think your demands are too high . The 20% price cut is more than we can give .
David , we sold 4 times as much last year as 2 years ago .
I understand what you're saying you think we're selling a lot more now , so we should have much better economies of scale .
That's righ .
When we started selling for you your prices were a little high , but we knew the quality was very goo .
And your point is .
My point is that by time your costs for making each item must have come down a lot .
I understand why you think that's true but you've forgotten some things .
Labor costs have gone up .
But those aren't costs that you should expect giant George to pay for .
We don't , and we've never passed costs on to you .
So you're saying your costs have been going up , not down .
No , in fact they've stayed about the same .
But because we're very happy with our relationship with you , we're willing to offer a 10% price cut anyway .
I appreciate that . David , I think 10% is acceptabl .
Alright . Let's get down to business .
We need to make some final decisions on the price of the soccer safety equipment . The tennis nets and the new rackets .
Right .
Because of the size of your order and our successful deals in the past , we'll offer you a 15% discount across the board .
That's good , but since you've raised the price by 25% . We still have a price rise of 6.25% .
Tom . We've talked about this and you knew the reason already .
Yeah , I know .
It's okay for a low turnover item like the tennis nets but for soccer equipment and tennis rackets . We won't make a satisfactory profit .
Prices will be rising everywhere because of the rise in materials cost .
And with the summer coming you'll really make a killing on all the soccer and tennis items .
Yes , I know they're both summer sports but what exactly are you suggesting .
Well , it's been my experience that decreasing your mark up will increase your turnover rat .
I don't think that's feasibl .
We've always used a 22% mark up on all items from active sports .
If you keep it at 22% . You'll turn over the goods once , maybe twice a month . But if you lower it to 19% you'll double your turn over rate .
How can you be so sure about that .
It has worked well for our other customers .
As well , the rackets and soccer equipment will be in great demand in the summer season . As I said .
I guess a 22% mark up might be a little high . However , the price rise will still be a shock to my bos .
Tom . Perhaps we can compromise on this .
If you can lower the mark-up , we can give you a 17% Discount your order is important to us .
Okay . I think you have yourself a deal .
I'm very much impressed with your silks the colors are charming and the feel is good .
I would be obliged for your quotation .
Could you give me an idea as to the quantity you'd like to order from us .
As you know any price depends on how large an order i .
This is the first time I've dealt in Chinese silks I need to try the Canadian market with a small quantity though your silks have been enjoying a high reputation around the world .
As a start , I'd like to order 500 bale .
That number is far below what we have expected but it's reasonable for a star .
For single palace silks our current price is $135 per bale and $165 for double palace .
You mean FOB Qingdao .
Yes .
Please excuse my speaking candidly I would tend to argue that the price , you've given is a bit on the high Side it compares very unfavorably with those of other origins Japan Pakistan and India , for instanc .
Considering the quantity of your order . This is the best offer we can make for YOU : we think it is rock-bottom price , indeed .
I heard that the Japanese silks are more brightly colored and beautifully designed and their price is lower on the FOB basi .
Our company has an office in Japan a large quantity of our silks are sold there .
The latest market report might show that our FOB price is much lower than what you may possibly obtain from Japan .
And you should not ignore the quality of our silks when comparing with that of the prices in the countries you name .
I'm sorry to say I really can't see my way to your quotation .
You know no material however attractive will be sold . If it is expensive .
I won't accept your price unless you allow me a 10% discount .
Well , a 10% discount is out of the question . Unless your order is a bit large .
I hope you will reconsider it .
That seems to be a point that will slow down our talk . Let's leave it to the end of the talk and deal with other terms first .
Since you can't accept the term right away . I have no objection to your proposal .
What would you like to talk about first .
I'd like to talk about packing and Packaging proper packaging is as important as the quality of the product itself : What do you use for packing silks .
We use transparent polyfilm to wrap the silks first and then pack them in cartons with double straps .
Silks packed in cartons are not quite sea-worth .
I once had a serious problem with a shipment of towels Most of the cartons were broken and damaged it caused me great trouble .
The cartons are only the outer packing inside is the transparent polyfilm wrapped silks .
That's good . A well-designed package helps tell the gods .
Buyers are always influenced by the Packages your silks enjoy a high reputation in the world market . You can compete successfully in a good many commodities if you pack the goods properly .
I agree with you but customers should also learn that appearances are deceptive sometimes .
That's True , the quality of the products is the first priority when marketing the .
Speaking of the design , we can meet the client's needs for all sorts of designs and colors but the cost will go up .
I se .
What is your normal packing 2 bales or 4 bales in a carton .
For a normal carton , we have 4 bales of the same color in a carton , but we also have small packing with only one Bale in a carton .
That's nice . Probably you heard that many consumer products in our country are being sold through mail order houses and this business is booming Therefore , we have adopted small packing to suit this new development .
You mean you want small packing right .
I'm no exception . Even though the cost may be a little bit higher . It's worth it . That is the reason why I have to order a small quantity for a trial ru .
One more point a second development in packaging is that some customers are asking for consumer packs . I mean a pack which allows the products to be put directly onto store shelves .
I understand .
With the diversified merchandising of supermarkets . There has been a trend toward smaller packages .
Packing is a real skill .
Anyway , Mr. Xu . We have settled the packing .
I will inform you of my decision concerning price tomorro .
I must be off now . Thank you and see you tomorrow .
See you .
By the way , I will pick you up at 6 for the Peking opera .
Sure , I will be ready by that time .
I almost forgot See you at 6 .
Mr. Xu . I am quite satisfied with our previous talks concerning the silks .
Now shall we go down to the matters concerning shippin .
Silks are seasonal goods in North America . So I need a delivery within a month . Can you make a prompt shipment .
A prompt shipment .
It's a real problem for , there's a great demand for shipping lately .
I know it's another hard-nut to crack , but I have to have the silks for summer sale .
I understand that . But yesterday I was informed by our shipping department that liner space for North America up to the end of this month has been fully booked .
I'm afraid we can do very little about a direct shipment until the second week of next month .
I understand tramps are still available .
Yes but tramps are scarce . I'm not sure whether there would be enough tonnage to make a full cargo even if a tramp could be obtained .
Is there any chance of transshipment being allowed .
But transshipment adds to the expenses risks of damage and sometimes may delay arrival because there is also a shortage of transshipment space for North America .
Anyway , we'll try .
We have very good connections with the China Resources shipping and Storage Co Ltd in Hong Kon .
This company has a great reputation in the shipping worl .
And since it has long term agency agreements with many world famous shipping companies . It can easily meet the client's varied demands .
I prefer direct shipment of course but if you can't get hold of a direct vessel I may agree to have the goods trans shipped at any port like Dalian Shanghai or even Hong Kong .
You know , good quality competitive price all would mean nothing . If the goods could not be put on the market on time .
I see your point .
We'll check the situation about the connecting steamer right away .
The best way is to get a containerized vessel destined for Vancouver .
I called home last night my partner told me Jardine shipping agent Ltd has a liner , sailing from Hong Kong to Canada around early june , if you could manage to catch that vessel everything would be all right .
It's very hard for us to accept a Designated on carrier Are you sure . The vessel will call at Vancouver and she is not carrying a full load .
I believe if we start immediately . There's still some hop .
And if worse comes to worst please ship the goods to Toronto or another port near Vancouver .
Good , then what would you say if we put it like this shipment first available steamer in June port of destination Vancouver or toronto transshipment at other ports allowe .
I think this is the earliest possibility .
Fine .
We MAY put it in the clause of the contract .
I suggest that we talk about inspection and arbitration in case something unexpected happens .
That's Necessary , it is an important formality in international trade .
If the goods are found disqualified or short on arrival . Are we entitled to lodge claims .
You have the right Of reinspection and you may lodge claims with us if you find the quality or quantity does not conform to the contract and the bill of lading . There's no risk involved .
No . I hope not .
How do you stipulate the inspection for your import .
Inspection must be conducted before shipment by recognized surveyors .
Their reports may be taken as the basis for negotiating payment .
Our bureau at the port of destination shall reinspect the goods upon arrival .
The inspection certificate issued by them shall serve as the basis for filing claims .
Very reasonable . The interests of both the buyer and the seller are taken into account .
So as to our case shall the silks be inspected by the surveyors before you conduct the shipment .
Yes . And your side may reinspect if you like .
How do you conduct arbitration if a dispute occurs .
We have , the arbitration clause in our general terms and conditions but our usual practice to settle a dispute is in a friendly way with a view to developing a long-term relationship .
Arbitration is generally the last resort .
I agree .
I also believe in developing friendly business relations .
Well , Mr. Xu . I think we have settled . Most of the issues about my first business with you .
I feel that we will establish long term relations between us .
I appreciate your patience with me .
And I hope you don't think I'm a bore .
It's business .
No , not at all a successful business needs prudence .
I think we have made a good start in our business and well begun is half done .
That's true .
Next time I will bring more Canadian businessmen to Qingdao because I see my bright future in this beautiful city .
You are welcome to Qingdao any time .
Good morning . Mr. House you contacted home last night .
Yes . I made a long distance call to discuss my problems with some of my colleagues .
What did they say about our business .
All things considered , we've agreed to your quotation on the CIF basis .
But we'll do it on condition that both sides should try to come to a balanced trade as far as circumstances permi .
Yes that's understood .
Now let's come to the terms of payment .
I suggest that D A should be used for this transaction .
I have to say no to your suggestion .
Our usual practice requires all orders to be covered by L C and therefore we can't make an exception in this case .
You know L C is the most commonly used mode of payment in import and export .
Well , I don't see why we can't accept L C since other firms have accepted it .
I'll make arrangements with our bank to open a confirmed irrevocable L C to cover our orders and shipment from Qingdao to Vancouver .
That's fine and it must be settled in US dollars .
How long should our L C be valid . That is , when should we set the expiry date .
30 days before shipment .
According to our company policy the L C must be a confirmed and irrevocable one though we know for certain that an international businessman like you will never default .
I understand that since I am your new client and it is in line with the practice of international trade .
Another thing to be discussed , is that since I have never bought silks from you before , our customers demand that 90% of the credit amount be paid on sight . That is against the presentation of Documents The rest is to be paid after the silks have arrived in Vancouver .
No . Mr. House that can't be done .
We have never done business on such terms .
We ask for full payment on sight because we guarantee the quality for all our products .
Quality is important , of course , but if your terms compare favorably with those of other suppliers . I have good reason to believe that we could place regular orders for you .
We'd like to do business with you , but only on the terms of international practice and standards .
I know our products sell extremely well in North America , especially in summer .
With good quality and charming color they will attract your customers and you will certainly make a profit from business with us .
I believe silks will bring us closer ties .
Thank you for encouraging me .
In fact , I am just worrying about what the silks will look like when I get them in Vancouver .
I know very little about your cargo insurance policy .
That is why I put forth 90% of the credit amount to be paid on sight .
We have insurance companies everywhere and they deal with all sorts of insurance concerning cargo damage such as FPA WPA and TPND etc .
If you want to know the detailed insurance business we may seek advice from the Pacific Insurance Company , which is not far from here .
That's necessar .
We may discuss insurance late .
But now let's come back to our payment terms .
So many things have to be decided before signing the contract .
I agree with you .
But our terms of payment are definite I cannot make any change .
Well , it seems that the only way for me is to accept your idea .
Would you please repeat some of the main points .
My pleasure .
Open a L C 30 days before Shipment cover your offers and other expenses in US dollar .
The total amount must be paid in full upon receipt of the documents .
All is clear .
It's been a pleasure talking with you , Mr. Xu . You are one of the best negotiators I've ever know .
I hope we'll have many years of fruitful cooperation .
I hope so . And I look forward to the day we sign our contract .
Yes .
After all the things are cleared up we can find a place to cheer our success with Qingdao beer . Okay .
Sure . I'd like that and with sea cucumber .
No . No way .
Hello . May I speak to Mr. Johnson , please .
Yes . This is Johnson speaking .

Mr. Chairman . Members of the Association .
Thank you for your warm Welcome It is good to be able to be here today and speak before your group .
I am a lawyer and I spend a lot of my time now with lawyers who are generally fine people but to spend time with farmers again is a little like coming home .
I feel very comfortable in a group like this with people like yourselves .
I spent a lot of my younger years on my family's farm so farming is in my Blood you can put me in a suit and stick me in an office in town , but you can't change my heart and my heart is with land and the people .
And that's a big reason for my decision to run for a legislative seat .
I see problems in this country that aren't being addressed by our officials who seem more interested in putting on a show for the television cameras than doing their work , sometimes our traditional society is changing and our country needs new young leaders among the people to ensure that these changes are for the best of all .
I am especially concerned that these changes don't leave the farmer with the short end of the stick .
Farmer's problems are what I've come to talk with you about today . The more I study the situation in our society . The more I realize how complex the problems are and how important is the need for cooperation and determination to achieve our goals .
If you are looking for someone to tell you that the answers to your problems are simple and that future is nothing but roses , then I'm not your man .
I don't see any simple answers and I feel that it will take a lot of hard work to keep our future prospects realistic and the future is going to require the farmer , as well as all segments of our society to change in order to meet the challenges .
I think the main problems facing farmers today are competition for land maintenance of long-term productivity and soil conservation . The opening of domestic markets to foreign producers and the future of government subsidies and price stabilization programs .
I'd like to talk briefly about these problems . Now , and during the question and answer session . I'll elaborate further on each point .
Competition for lands is becoming more serious in Our country we have to accept the need of cities and industry to expand onto traditional farming lands . However we must set limits on this expansion and establish fair compensation guidelines to use when land is appropriated soil conservation practices must begin to be implemented as a routine matter : The government must help the farmer by sponsoring research and encouraging proper cultivation techniques . The opening of the domestic agricultural markets to foreign producers has been an unfortunate consequence of the trade imbalance in the industrial sector farmers are being penalized for industry's exports government subsidies and price stabilization programs should be subject to a systematic and periodic review to ensure that the programs are really helping the farmer and not just allowing a few to get rich without producing anything if a program is not functioning properly , then those financial resources questions now . For me , so I'll conclude my speech and we can begin a substantive discussion .
Thank you for allowing me this opportunity to speak before you TODAY . I hope you will decide to support my candidacy for office . I need your help now and when I'm elected you can count on my support for the farmer .
Thank you very much for your time today . It can change our future tomorrow .
Mr. Mayor . Members of the government . Ladies and gentleme .
Our coming together today signifies the start of an important project's construction phase of Taipei . I want to welcome you to the ground breaking ceremony for the new headquarters of the Taipei Railway Administration and the Taipei train and subway station located here in central Taipei .
This project brings under one roof . All the heads of the departments in the Taipei Railway Administration and their staff , they will occupy the 3rd to the 6th floors , the 7th floor will house the new computer facilities . The first and second floors will be the train and subway station while the 3 subterranean floors will be the platforms and maintenance areas .
This project has been in the planning stages for more than 5 years and represents a collective effort by all level of government . Its importance has enabled this project to avoid much of the political infighting and posturing which has plagued other projects .
When we examine this project closely . We can safely conclude that it is a sure thing that the people will benefit from this projec .
The benefits of the project are many .
First , the consolidation of all administrative functions under one roof will greatly increase the efficiency of managing the railway system .
A lot of duplicity that was necessary when the various offices were scattered around Taipei can be eliminated .
The installation and use of the new computer facilities will allow better understanding of the rail system and allow maximum use of the resources available to the railway administration .
The completion of this building in 2 years will coincide with the completing of the underground rail system in the greater Taipei area the underground rail system will eliminate above ground rail lines , plus several important trunk lines in the Metropolitan area . The increased use of the rail system by commuters once the new rail lines are operating will greatly ease the pressures of surface traffic and help alleviate some of the air and noise pollution caused by private vehicles .
In summary , this project's completion will mean better rail service plus faster circulation of passengers and freight all at lower cost to the government with a cleaner environment for the residents of Taipei .
Today , let us together turn the first shovelful of earth and in 2 years together we can dedicate the New Taipei train and subway station and Taipei Railway Administration Building .
Mr. Chairman . Ladies and gentlemen .
I really don't know what to say , except Thank you . When I was invited here tonight . I had no idea that this was going to happen . So I haven't prepared anything to say .
When I recall . Others who have accepted this award in the past . I feel quite undeserving .
I've known for some time of this organization's charitable deeds and progressive ideas and I feel it is an honor to be selected to receive this award . I feel very lucky because I really enjoy my work even though sometimes it is hard , and sometimes I think of giving it up for something EASIER at times you think that you've seen it all . By now , only to be confronted with a family's situation that is worse than you ever imagined possible but then I see a sparkle in an old man's tired eyes I feel people's hearts changing opening up again and I know this is where I must be and this is the work I must be doin .
So many times I've seen that last little sparkle of humanity left in a person catch hold rekindle a flame that burns brighter than ever this I count as my real reward .
There are so many others more deserving of this award . I work with dozens of people who see the same conditions .
I think the children's division is providing some excellent resources to very needy People the people working with the elderly must really be thanked also for all they do .
I must thank my wonderful family for their support and encouragement .
My husband is a wonderful man who helps in so many way .
My children are continual source of love and inspiration .
I only wish I had more time to be with them .
My church also plays an important role in strengthening our family ties and providing me with a faith to carry on through all the trials that life presents to m .
On behalf of all my co-workers and my family . I'll just say thank you for this award which symbolizes your own concern for the less fortunate and disadvantaged in our society . Thank you .
Ladies and gentlemen .
Today's meeting will be a most memorable occasion for me because it is my time to thank everyone for their support and encouragement in the past year during my tenure as president of this group .
Serving as your president gave me the opportunity to work with everyone here and I count that one of the greatest personal rewards I received during the last yea .
I remember how at first I was unsure of my ability to function effectively as your president . But now with every member's unselfish contribution to our work here the job became a joy to m .
Our successes this year are a direct result of the active participation of all the members in our group .
I am especially proud of the success of this year's Arbor Day Fund Drive Ms Lin Qiu lan as chairperson of the tree sales Committee was directly responsible for the highest sales ever recorded during this Activity As a result , we are able to carry on some of our most important projects and thousands of trees were distributed to Taipei residents for planting thus contributing to the beautification of our city for years to come .
Also I must give the credit to MS Chiang for organizing . Some of the most memorable and interesting programs for each of our monthly meetings and her programs provided much useful information about local plants and flowers about producing better gardens and many other topics .
With your continuing support . In the coming year . Ms Juliet , our new President can carry on our important work of beautifying our homes and our city .
Some unfinished complete next yea .
I am thinking , particularly of the project for developing a small , downtown park .
For giving me the opportunity to serve as president to serve our city and to work with everyone here I give my sincere thanks to YOU : This has been a most memorable year for me and I hope our group continues to grow and prospers in the FUTURE . Thank you .
Ladies and gentlemen .
It's with great pleasure that I welcome you here today to the first anniversary celebration of the founding of the magazine Nature .
Never could we have imagined a year ago that we would have come so far in so short a TIME . But here we are at the end of year one , and what a fantastic year It Has Been let me review our achievements in the first yea .
We've published 12 very impressive pieces of literature each month somehow surpassing the quality and depth of the previous month's edition .
Our creative and talented staff won 2 writing awards and 2 photographic awards in this short time . Also , the popularity of the magazine has far exceeded even the most optimistic forecasts of our marketing staff .
And I feel that the acceptance of our magazine by people is the most rewarding aspect of this projec .
I can remember about 2 years ago when there was only a small group of 4 People . We had an idea for a nature oriented magazine but we all had doubts about the general acceptance of the idea whether there would be enough interest from people to sustain us during the early development stage we assembled the finest people we could find and decided from the start to produce the highest quality product as possible . We would .
Today it's a wonderful feeling to know that we have succeeded and everyone here shares the credit for making this magazine . What it has become .
This is a special group of people and I'm proud to be a part of what you have helped create walking among you today talking and listening . I am struck at the feeling of excitement . I can sense in the new ideas and directions I hear being discussed .
While it is a formidable task for us all . I know that we are going to make the next year , an even more successful venture and I'm sure that next year at this time , we'll have more awards and more subscribers and feel an even greater sense of accomplishment and fulfillment .
Congratulations on our great success this year . And good luck for continued success in our second year .
Ladies and gentlemen .
Would you believe it if I said that there is a large group of workers in Taiwan who are largely being ignored by the business community Here workers who are able , reliable and conscientious workers who if given the most dependable loyal employees .
As a group , this organization represents a large proportion of Taiwan's business leaders , men and women who have climbed the ladder of success and know the Ropes . I appreciate this opportunity to address such an important group and hope my words will prove of some benefit to you .
You will certainly benefit in your respective companies by hiring the disabled or handicapped persons a disabled person undeniably has some physical limitations . Maybe this person is confined to a wheelchair maybe that person has to use crutches to move around , maybe another doesn't have full use of one or both of his Arms . But whatever physical handicap confronts the disabled worker you rest assured it is overcome by development in other areas .
Please don't misunderstand my meaning here TONIGHT disabled persons aren't looking for charity for a handout , they are looking for , opportunity for an alternative to not even being considered for regular employment .
A few examples , might make this cleare .
John Smith had polio as a child and has great trouble moving around even on crutches . But that didn't stop John from forming and managing a very successful computer software company part of John's successful formula is using several disabled employees who form the backbone of his research and development section Mary Liu denied entrance to Taiwan's university system because a car accident left her confined to a wheelchair is presently in an Honor's master's program at a large California graduate school studying Business Management Robert David works as a secretary for a large trading company and greatly impressed his superiors with his efficiency and industriousness .
These are certainly special people . But they aren't unique , there are many others like them who given the chance , will prove that they too are special .
Next time , a disabled person is applying for a job at your company . Take the time to consider this person . Seriously .
I know that you will not be disappointed in your choice of a disabled person to fill the job after all we are all human .
Thank you for your time tonight .
Ladies and gentlemen .
Tonight , I'd like to speak on a very important yet uncomfortable subject a situation exists in the world right now that is so terrible so inhumane that I think you will agree that we must respond .
As I look out over the faces here I see many friends people I've known for years , people I know who have good hearts and want the best for others as well as for themselves and their Families That's why I'm speaking in front of this group . I know that you will respond to this urgent plea for help .
As you finish the last of your dessert here tonight after a wonderfully prepared meal . It is hard to imagine being hungry to imagine not having had a good meal today for a few days for a few weeks . But there are millions of people in the world today who are in just this situation . People who are literally starving to death in a most painful and pathetic way .
In particular the world's attention has been fixed on the people of Somalia . Hundreds of thousands of people living at the edge of starvation and death , victims of circumstances beyond their control .
A capricious climate which has led to many years of drought , coupled with a practice of overusing the land resources has made the land useless for growing crops or grazing animals and if this were not enough . This region of Africa is torn by civil war and strife forcing these defenseless and starving people to escape periodic fighting .
When we see pictures of these emaciated beings starving mothers with starving babies , children with bloated stomachs and we've all seen them . I think our first reaction is to turn away because it's too painful to confront this reality , but we must be stronger than the page there is no escape . And with this in mind , we begin to realize the depth of their plight and the need for action on our part .
But what can we really do .
How can we really help these people .
I've studied this question over the past few months and investigated all the organizations which in one way or another are connected to the relief effort in Somalia . I've discovered that there is a great difference in the effectiveness of the various groups working with this problem . And I'd like to describe the organization . I think we should support .
This organization is a private group started by individuals . Much like yourselves who have seen this situation and want to help .
Very little money donated to this group goes to administrative costs , as most of these functions are performed by volunteers . The aid provided is given to those most in need . None is funneled through the government the types of aid provided are designed to meet different Needs foodstuffs are sent to some of the most needy refugee centers for direct distribution tools and training in better farming methods are being distributed in 3 pilot projects initiated by this group also this group is trying to focus international attention on the leaders of the warring factions to try to pressure them into negotiating a settlement and thus bring about a long sought after and much needed peace to the region .
This group is relatively small and needs financial and volunteer support from people worldwide to meet the challenges of this problem .
I know all of you want to help with this problem in Somalia and I feel this direction will be most effective .
I have prepared some information packets about this problem and about this organization that I will gladly pass out to interested parties after the Meeting I think this is a good way to help our fellow human beings who are in a very dangerous and hopeless situation .
Thank you for your time tonight and thank you for the help . I know that will be forthcoming .
Ladies and gentlemen .
On behalf of the fund-raising Committee . I'd like to announce our decision to sponsor a run which we've named the dog Trot It will be a 5 kilometer foot race around the buildings in downtown Taipei late September .
Running is a great way to get into shape for you and your dog as there are nearly 2 months before the race . Everyone has plenty of time to practice .
Not only will there be awards for the fastest men , women and children in each age division but there will also be many door prizes to be given away to lucky participants of the race .
Ed Brown is soliciting donations from local businesses for door prizes and I understand these will include some free veterinarian services as well as free dinners at some fine restaurants plus lots of other Surprises at the race . We will also have water and fruit for the runners .
Everyone is needed to help on this project because of its importance in telling people about our society and the work we are trying to do plus raising money for our other Activities and there is much to be done to prepare for it . Susan Jones is in charge of the race itself and will need up to 15 people on race day to help with registration and crowd and traffic control rich Ashton will man the information booth at the race and says he will need one or 2 people on the day of the race , plus 2 people with artistic skills to help in him design the booth over the next few weeks I am in charge of promotion and I have 2000 fliers that need to be posted around town where many people can see the .
So there is a lot of work to be done , but we feel it will be a good way to focus attention on the humane plus a fun way to raise money for our wor .
The race is scheduled for Sunday , September 24 at 6:30 in the morning , the start and finish lines will be at the front gate of Chung Shan Memorial on Chung Shan South Roa .
We need everyone's support for this . So think about what you can contribute and after tonight's meeting is adjourned come to this table to sign up for the various tasks and also take home a handful of fliers to pass out at your work , school and neighborhood .
Your participation will guarantee a successful race . Thank you .

Today , opens the second International Conference on the greenhouse effect and global warming .
The importance of this issue is evidenced by the participation of United Nations and government representatives scientists academics industry personnel and representatives of Native tribal groups from all over the world .
Global warming is with us . Now the trends of atmosphere will lead to a partial melting of the polar ice caps , which will raise the level of the oceans by as much as few meters inundating the homes of an estimated 1 billion people .
The warming trend will play havoc with the world's climate changing and expanding the location and extent of the world's deserts altering weather patterns in the major food producing areas , leading to possible patterns starvation .
Warmer air and ocean temperatures will spawn a new generation of super hurricanes and there will be other as yet unforeseen catastrophes .
Our task is to understand the meaning of this and prepare some concrete steps to be taken .
Our focus over the next few days will first be a complete review of all recent and current research results concerned with the phenomena of global warming .
A serious effort will the made to synthesize this massive amount of information into a coherent easily understandable summary and to understand and resolve together to work through the many hurdles that lay in our way .
This group has the potential to help launch a far-reaching effort to alter man's idea of his world and to alleviate his adverse effects on it .
We are optimistic that this conference is an important beginning step in the right direction . We hope by the week's end to find all of you eager to return to your homes , families and jobs ready to continue the struggle for the earth's survival .
Thank you for coming .
Friends .
Welcome to the annual meeting of the sales representatives of close weave textiles .
As president of this company , I would like to say a few words to open this weekend . Concerning your role in the company and also some thoughts about being a Salesman our agenda for the weekend is designed to fully acquaint you with our new line of products and new manufacturing techniques and delivered by the best of our research team plus provide some helpful suggestions and proven strategies for better selling from some veterans on our staff .
The Sales Department represents one of the most vital links of our company with other industries and buyers .
Our record sales for the last 2 years are a direct result of your hard work and dedication , and I know that this trend will continue for many years . Your record is even more remarkable given some of the disturbances in the local scene from time to time and the often-confusing international trade . Picture .
In preparing my remarks for tonight I began to reflect on one of the finest people I've ever known and one of the most successful salesman ever to work HERE only those of us who have been around for a long time will remember Mr. Johnson Smith . I think this man's remarkable success can be attributed to some important ideas first Mr. Smith's perseverance was AMAZING He would work all the angles he would strive to understand the buyer's needs in great detail and offer them exactly what they were seeking his personal attention and interest showed that this concern was for their welfare and satisfaction not just making a sale .
His knowledge of his product lines and its manufacturing processes was unsurpassed by anyone else in the business .
He had a quick , sharp mind but mostly he intensely studied his markets . He would read all he could get about the particular field . He was working in at the moment .
Over the years this pursuit of knowledge led to an understanding of all levels of the manufacturing processes in many diverse industries .
More than this though he possessed an understanding of the Human Spirit he knew about all the current events and would speak with authority on the important issues in the news not as one armed with a lot of facts , but as one who was in love with life .
I think the most important parts of being a successful salesman are meeting your customers' needs first having a complete knowledge of the business you are working in and treating your customers as friends . First , and business associates second .
As you think of your own business dealings . Perhaps these suggestions could prove fruitful if you incorporate them into your Program . I wish you all the success in the world and hope that we can repeat our record-setting sales for another year .
Ladies and gentlemen .

We are all saddened by the recent passing of George Stephenson at tonight's meeting . I want to take time out to remember this great man and his contributions to this organization and to our entire society .
Mr. Stephenson was a leader in both business and government in our city .
As the president of Lawton Textiles . He turned that company into a very successful enterprise whose business connections now span the globe .
His leading role in the formation of the American textile market greatly benefited the entire domestic textile industry his international prestige was utilized by the government in last year's trade negotiations with the European Community's textile importers for America to secure continuing share of that market .
Mr. Stephenson was a long-standing member of this organization who served unselfishly for over 20 Years . He served as the secretary for a total of 4 years as vice president for 2 years in a row and as president , for a total of 3 years .
His chairmanship of many committees and active participation in many others is a testament to his devotion to the goals of this organization .
In talking with many of you over the past few days I am struck by 2 feelings .
First , everyone spoke of the great enthusiasm which characterized Mr. Stephenson's wor .
He was never too busy to help a friend his door was always open to listen to a co-worker's needs and Advice also Mr. Stephenson always seemed able to motivate the good parts of one's personality .
May times he extended a helpful hand to a troubled young person offered an opportunity for being out of the trouble and somehow always stimulated that young person to turn their life around and leave their troubled times behind his faith in the basic goodness of the human spirit will be a lasting inspiration to us all .
Mr. Stephenson and his service to this organization and to our society will be remembered by all .
We have surely lost a valuable and irreplaceable friend and associate May his memory serve as an inspiration for us to continue his good works .
Ladies and gentlemen .
I have the pleasure now of announcing the recipient of the Humanitarian Service Award , which we present once a year to an individual whose contributions to bettering the lives of our citizens are particularly outstanding .
While this is only a symbolic gesture . It is hoped that the work that people are engaged in will be highlighted by this award .
2 months ago . Our committee asked level of possible recipients who have exhibited a special level of the commitment and courage in our struggle to better the condition of our people .
Our committee carefully investigated the names it received . And as there were several people who had done much in the past few years the selection of just one of them was difficult . However , we have selected a most deserving person .
Our Award goes to a woman who has been a tower of strength to all who are around HER as a government social worker she helps the very poorest families try to get on their FEET she visits the homes of her clients discusses their situation and problems and works to resolve the worst problems so that some of the family members can begin to work outside the home to support the family .
In cases where people are incapable of working , she arranges for the appropriate agencies to provide for the families .
It's a difficult job to face , day after day visiting the poorest most neglected people in our society , but this remarkable woman does this and more .
In researching her accomplishments our committee talked to many of the people she has helped over the years , and they all speak of her understanding and compassion of her strength and spirit , which many said gave them a feeling of hope something they had abandoned .
Her co-workers hold her in the highest regards and marvel at her energy and devotion to her work .
In addition to her work . She and her husband are raising 2 daughters . She is active in a local church and also participates in activities at her daughters' school .
So please join with me in congratulating , this year's recipient of our Humanitarian Service Award Susan Wang .
Ms Wang , would you please come forward to receive your award .
Ladies and gentlemen .
A problem has surfaced recently between the US and H G government concerning the lack of protection of intellectual property and the failure to observe copyright laws in this country as H G government strives to become more active in international affairs on an equal footing with other nations . It must begin to pay more attention to generally recognized conventions , such as copyright laws .
Copyright laws protect an idea a product or a publication from use by unauthorized people for a specified length of time , usually several YEARS people can only use copyrighted material if they obtain permission from the holders of the copyright .
Often a fee is charged for the privilege of using copyrighted material .
Many companies invest large amounts of money in research to develop new ideas and products . These new ideas allow the company to have a competitive advantage over others in the same Industry these advantages mean a more attractive product to sell or some new innovation , which changes the face of the whole industry , as in the compact disc boom of recent YEARS . The company may also choose to sell the copyrighted information to other companies for large sums of money .
H G government has largely ignored international copyright laws until very recently when it has experienced external pressure to conform to these LAWS by ignoring their laws manufacturers could immediately incorporate new ideas and designs into their products without spending the money on research , thus allowing them to stay competitive with foreign companies .
Are copyright laws . A good idea , after all .
Some people argue that the protection of new ideas and products shows down further developments . The race for an AIDS treatment or vaccine and the push to prove cold nuclear fusion are good examples to illustrate this criticism .
Perhaps better more effective medicines could be developed more quickly . If all the different pharmaceutical companies weren't competing against each other , and instead were working together .
Likewise , it seems that most researchers aren't interested in how cold nuclear fusion will benefit mankind but only in how it will benefit their schools or companies financially or their own careers .
There are also claims that copyright laws are used to restrict access of developing countries to new technology they need to build their industries and stay competitive with the developed countries By contrast , I think it could be argued that computer industry has greatly benefited from a more relaxed exchange of new ideas and innovations , allowing the industry to move forward as a whole . More rapidly than it otherwise might have .
Certainly the lure of large profits from new ideas and new products are a driving force behind research today . The copyright laws are a part of the way business is done and as such must be respected by the members of the International community perhaps one way to get around the system in this country is for the government to sponsor research in important fields and then make new developments available to all in the industry who could use IT . The country would as a whole benefit from such an arrangement .
I'm sure the government will recognize the importance of adherence to the international copyright agreements and will work with us in policing H G for violators . This will encourage innovative developments at home allow you to shed the copycat image and assume the more appropriate role of a leader in the world community .
Would you like to play Chinese chess with me .
With pleasur .
Fielding .
It's nothing .
As a matter of fact , I'm only a beginner .
Oh look , There is a chessboard . Those 2 men have already finished playing .
You're a very good playe .
You're flattering me .
But once I won a prize .
So did I .
I won a prize last week but it was just a prize for beginners .
My prize was for the best player in the country .
Really .
How I admire you .
Could you play another kind of chess game .
Yes . When I was a little boy I was fond of Chinese draughts and army chess .
Me too .
And later I learned how to play Chinese chess .
At about 11 years old I was taught to play chess .
But I got really to love this game . Only 3 years ag .
How about you .
I can play weiqi .
Great .
Then , let's have a game of weiq .
Okay .
But after we finish playing chess .
Now let's be serious .
All right , it's your turn .
How is this year's Sino Japan chess Challenge tournament going on .
Chinese 9th dan player Ma Xiaochun takes on Japan's 9th dan player Kataoka Satosi for the 10th match today .
I am sure Ma Xiaochun will win for he is the newly crowned Sino Japan Masters champion .
I am not so optimistic .
Ma Xiaochun , has never beaten Kataoka Satosi in their 4 previous encounters .
What is the result so far .
In the previous 9 games Japan won 5 while China took 4 .
China has to win the last 2 games to win the series .
Where will the game be played .
At the China's chess academy in Beijing .
Who will be Ma's next opponent if he wins today .
If he wins , he will play Awazi Shuzo .
What will happen if he loses .
9th dan Chinese Nie Weiping will take over .
By the way the CCTV will show the game live on Channel 8 from 4 to 6:00 PM .
Chinese weightlifter Yang Bin won the first gold medal of the first East Asian Games .
Wonderful .
Which class is he i .
He is in 54kg class .
What are his total results .
He lifted a total of 262.5kg .
His total results leveled the listed Asian record of 262.5kg set by himself in Fuzhou .
Why did the Korean who also lifted 262.5kg only get the silver medal .
Because he weighs more than Yang Bi .
Is that the reason .
That's quite interesting .
This rule is very reasonable and fair .
What do you think of the standard of the top Chinese weightlifter .
No doubt they are among the best in the worl .
There are some very talented individual lifters .
In your opinion , how can we improve the general standard of our lifters .
Firstly , China should have a regional and national squad system for the top weightlifters .
Secondly , China should introduce a youth development program for young lifters . This should help to promote the sport among young people .
You've put forward very good suggestions . I think , especially the second one . China should do pay more attention to young people , they are the future of our motherland .
Excuse me , Bernard , what are the measures of a weightlifting platform .
In general it is 6 meters long and 4 meters wid .
What are the basic requirements of the lifting .
The weightlifter should lift the bar above head height with arms locked out and both feet in line .
Of course there are numerous detailed requirements and rule .
I read from yesterday's newspaper that Ms Ding Meiyuan from China won the gold of the women's 75 kilograms plus class .
She is something .
Just imagine raising 300 kilograms , at a time .
Actually 300 kilograms , is the total of the weights she raised both in the snatch and the clean and jerk .
I didn't know tha .
What's the difference .
In the snatch the competitor raises the barbell in one uninterrupted motion from the platform floor to a position over the hea .
But in the clean and jerk the barbell is raised to the shoulder height held there briefly and then pushed overhead in a rapid motion of the arms .
I se .
In fact , the clean and jerk consists of 2 step .
For each style the competitor is allowed 3 attempts and the best of the 3 results is adopted to indicate his true ability .
How many referees are there in a weightlifting competition .
3 referees .
They will judge whether the lift is a good lift or a no lift .
How do they show their judgment .
For a good lift at least 2 of the 3 referees signal with a white light to show that they approve the lift .
A red light is the signal for a no-lift .
If 2 or more referees disapprove the lift then the result of the attempt is invalid .
I've got it .
I like many sports such US basketball football table tennis badminton tennis but I don't know about weightlifting .
Can you tell me something about it .
Sure .
Weightlifting is the sport of lifting the heaviest weight possible .
Heavy metal discs are attached to a barbell .
The object is to lift the bar above head height with the arms locked out and both feet in line .
Barbell .
It is called barbell .
I even don't know how to call it .
It must be very heavy .
It is heavy but the lifters can perform miracles .
How about Chinese weightlifting .
China is a dominant nation in world weightlifting .
That's great . I think each lifter must be very stron .
Yes .
Lifters began to practice when they were very youn .
What is the optimum starting age for young weightlifters .
The optimum starting age is 10 .
In my country weightlifting clubs hold training classes for children aged from 10 to 12 and from 13 to 1 .
Maybe these young weightlifters will become world champions someday in the near future .
We're sure they can .
Excuse me I have forgotten the 2 kinds of weightlifting .
The 2 kinds are snatch and clean and jerk . It's easy to remember .
But what are the 2 techniques used in the snatc .
The 2 techniques are the split and the squat .
And next , you want to ask what the difference between them is , am I right .
Yes , I am sorry to cause you trouble .
Never mind Let me tell you , but you should listen to the coach carefully next time .
Well in the split technique as the lifter lifts the barbell he thrusts his body underneath is at the same time he places one foot forwards and one foot backwards in a split position .
In the squat technique as the lifter lifts the bar , he bends his knees and goes down into a low squatting position at the same time he raises the bar with his arms fully extended overhead .
And one more thing . Both techniques can also be used in the clean and jerk but the lifter must finish with his body erect holding the barbell overhead .
His arms and legs must be straight with his feet in line .
Thank you for your help .
I'll concentrate my efforts next time .
That's fine .
What is the optimum starting age for a young gymnast .
The optimum starting age is 8 , although some children begin training at 6 Years Old in my country , we have a junior gymnastics development program for children aged from 8 to 10 .
When does a young gymnast reach her peak .
In recent years , female gymnasts have reached their peak between the age of 14 and 16 .
What are the physical qualities that a good gymnast require .
A good gymnast requires strength stamina flexibility coordination spring speed balance a sense of rhythm and good posture .
How about mental qualities .
A gymnast requires willpower and determination intelligence and creative expression of feelings .
Lu Li captured China's first gymnastics gold at the 25th Olympic Games .

What are the basic skills in trampoline .
Trampoline skills include twists and somersaults in a variety of positions .
At the Olympics . Each is given a degree of difficulty , the higher the difficulty the higher the score .
How many skills does a routine contain .
10 .
Each skill in an optional routine should be different . That is skills should not be repeated in the same routine .
For all skills apart from straddle jumps the legs should be kept together with the toes pointed .
And there is a rule .
What is it .
In the end , the trampolinists should be in an upright position for at least 3 seconds .
I guess , points will be deducted if he-she ends with an unstable position .
That's for sure .

Has he ever won the World Champion .

Saul : do the fencers use the same kind of sword .
No .
There are 3 kinds of swords used in the Olympic fencing foil saber and epe .
How do they differ .
The foil is the lightest of the 3 with a flexible rectangular blade .
The saber has a flexible blade with a cutting edge on one side .
And the epee is heavier than the foil and its blade is stiffer .
I don't think they've got the same rules have they .
No .
In foil and epee a touch can be considered valid only if it is made with the point of the weapon .
The entire body is a valid target for the epee but in foil a touch can be scored only on the body between the collar and hipbones .
In saber fencing a hit may be made with the point the cutting edge or the forward 3rd of the back edg .
And the target areas include any part of the body above the waist , including the head .
How do the judges award the score .
In fencing . It's really a tough job for the judges to correctly award the score .
So the electronic scoring system is adopted to record it .
When the valid part of the weapon touched the target area of the opponent's body . The system will record it automatically .
What are the main attacking skills in fencing .
The lunge . The fleche and the thrust are the main attacking skill .
And the most important defensive skill is the Parry , which is often followed by counter riposte .
The Olympic fencing tournament was delayed an hour .
What has happened .
A French official argued with the organizers over the draw .
What's the problem .
2 Frenchwomen were placed in the same pool .
Did they redraw .
Yes .
Meygret was redrawn to fence Germany's Dobermeier .
Did this please . The French .
No .
That did not please the French as the loser went directly out the tournament .
Meygret saved the situation by winning .
Is it possible for Chinese fencers to get any gold medals at this Olympics .
I am afraid not .
Why do you say so .
Because the most possible event is the women's foil fencing and our fencer Wang Huifeng has been nipped by world champion Trillini of Italy .
Wang Hifeng only took the silver didn't she .
Yes .
Wang Huifeng was defeated after a 3-set thriller .
I hope Chinese women's team will perform a miracl .
China is not a dominant nation in world fencing .
It's nothin .
China does well in many other Olympic sports .
Are you satisfied with Chinese players' achievements in the Olympic Games .
Yes .
They are excellent .
How about you .
Well , I think they could be better .
What do you think of the standard of the top Chinese fencers .
I think that they are among the best in Asia .
In your opinion , how can we improve the general standard of our fencers .
Firstly , China should have a development program for young fencers .
Secondly , we should study the performance and techniques of the top fencers on film and videotap .
Thirdly , we should invite a European coac .
And the fencers themselves should pay attention to the techniques while practicing .
Ye .
Improving the standard is the Chinese fencers is not just the coaches' business nor is just the fencers every one of us should work hard .
Good morning . Hector .
Hello , Annie .
Do you know that there will be some finals of the Olympic shooting events this afternoon and this evening .
I'd like to know something about it .
What do you want to know general information or specific and technical knowledge .
General information of course .
First , I'd like to know what events does the shooting program consist of .
There are 10 for men and 7 for wome .
And those events can be categorized into 4 groups the rifle the pistol running targets and those involving the clay pigeon .
What is the clay pigeon .
What events involve the clay pigeon .
Actually it's a disc-shaped target made of pitch and chalet thrown into the air for shooters to shoot .
Events like trap Skeet and double trap involve the clay pigeon .
What are the events of the pistol shooting .
Air pistol sport pistol free pistol and rapid-fire pistol .
How about the rifle .
The rifle shooting includes such events as air rifle standard rifle 3 positions .
Wai .
What do you mean by 3 positions .
The shooting positions of course standing kneeling and prone .
Who do you think is most likely to win the Air Pistol women's air pistol .
Tao Luna from China is sure to win , I bet .
These days , I've been studying the information concerning Olympic shooting .
You seem to have known the Olympic shooting out and out .
That's why you asked me rather than anyone else .
It is worth an all-night celebration for the Chinese shooting tea .
You mean the 2 gold medals won by Zhang Shan and Wang Yifu .
Exactly .
Zhang Shan outshot a field of male rivals to win the mixed skeet event and set a new Olympic final record with 223 hits .
That's great .
This is the first time in Olympic history that a woman won the mixed skeet title .
The other best result in this event by a woman was also achieved by a Chinese Wu Lanying , who finished 11th at the last Olympics in SEOUL before her no women had ever made the top 20 .
Unfortunately this is Zhang Shan's first and last chance to compete in the mixed event .
How come .
At the next Olympic Games in Atlanta in 1996 women and men will compete separately .
What's Zhang Shan's age .
She is 24 , and she will be 28 at the next Olympics .
28 is not an old age for a shooter .
How about Wang Yif .
He has already been 31 years ol .
What title did he captur .
Air pistol .
He also won a silver medal in free pistol 2 days ago .
What a sharp shooter .
Hi , I heard that you've been a shooter for over one year .
You are right .
Being a shooter is quite interesting .
I'm not familiar with shooting . It's an Olympic game isn't it .
Yes it is .
It became in an Olympic sport at the first modern Olympic in Athens in 1896 .
Can you explain the prone position to me .
I only know it is one of the shooting positions for the rifle event .
Of COURSE Let me tell you in the prone position the shooter lies flat on his stomach supporting the upper part of his body on his elbows the butt of the rifle is against the shooter's shoulder or shoulder blade pit and he has to hold the rifle with both of his hands .
It is difficult to do this I think .
No , it is not very difficult .
I hope you'll teach me to shoot when you're free .
I'd like to .
Now there are many shooting halls in big cities . People have regarded shooting as a recreational activity .
How far does the archer stand from the target , William .
70 meter .
What's the measure of the target .
Only l.22 meters in diameter .
It's really a challenging job to shoot at such a small target from so far AWAY . It must be very hard to hit the center .
It is .
The center is called the bull's eye It is worth 10 points .
Besides the bull's eye . The target is comprised of 9 concentric rings and the outer ring is worth 1.0 .
I noticed an inner ring within the bull's ey .
What is its function .
It does not count for extra points but is used to decid .
How the points should be counted . If an arrow bounces off the target or pierces it .
The score is taken from the mark left by the arrow as long as it can be identified .
No points are scored if an arrow misses the targe .
How does the archer aims at the target .
The archer holds the bow in his bow arm and draws back the target arrow at the anchor point with his drawing HAND he looks along the Bow sight then releases the arrow at the target .
Thank you . Williams .

When was modern pentathlon introduced to the Olympic Games .
It became an Olympic event , in 1912 .
It was designed by Pierre de Coubertin the chief , founder of the modern Olympic Games .
But unfortunately the modern Pentathlon's Olympic history has all too often failed to live up to the lofty ideals of its founder .
What do you mean by that .
In 1968 , Swedish competitor Hans Liljeavall was disqualified for consuming alcohol during the competition .
Such things have also happened to other events rather than modern pentathlon alone .
But the incidence is especially high in cases of modern pentathlon .
However , Australian pentathletes haven't been found to have taken any banned drugs or other banned substances during the competition .
It's not the cas .
At the Seoul Games of 1988 . Alex Watson failed a urine test , which showed he had excessive levels of caffeine in his system .
Really .
Watson was tested during the fencing competition and told the IOC medical commission hearing into the affair that he had drunk 12-15 cups of coffee and 2 or 3 cans of Coca-Cola at the venue . Over the 12 Hours of competition .
What was the resul .
This did not satisfy the Commission and Watson was disqualified and was given an hour to leave the Olympic Villag .
But maybe Watson had no intention to win by taking a banned substance .
Watson himself insisted that he was innocen .
Therefore athletes should be very careful with the food and medicine , he takes during the competition .
But the case of Boris Onishenko had no controvers .
I don't suppose he is an Australian .
No .
He is a pentathlete of former Soviet Union .
At the Montreal Games of 1976 he was disqualified for he tampered with his Epee , causing it to register hits even when none had been scored .
That's a real sham .
I'm interested in mountain climbing , but I've heard that it needs lots of preparations Is that true .
Yes , mountain climbing or mountaineering is exciting , but it's also Dangerous . So we have to be well prepared beforehan .
We have to have some basic things such as wind proof down jacket climbing boots alpenstock Piton hammer and nylon climbing rope .
Are those enough .
Well , if there is snow , you have to bring with you crampons an ice axe ice Piton and snow goggle .
And if the mountain is very high . You have to have an oxygen container or cylinder for easier breathing .
Well anyway I think mountaineering is very conductive to exercising courage and stamina .
Miguel has some very competitive rivals such as Filip Meirhaeghe from Belgium and Christoph Sauser from Switzerland .
What kind of bicycles do they rid .
Their bicycles are derailleurs light and STRONG They may have 5 to 15 speeds and each can be applied to a different terrain .
In general , low gears for going uphill or against the wind and high gears for pedaling downhill and they can be slowed by gripping levers on the handlebars .
The handlebars are different from those of most bikes . I saw in China last year which are an important means of transportation for the Chines .
The drop handlebars of the mountain bikes permit a low and comfortable riding position .
Look , Miguel begins to accelerate .
He has to break away from Filip and Christoph .
It seems that he wants to overtake from the left side .
Miguel stop .
He has to or he'll crash into Filip .
The competition is so fierce .
Now it is a competition between Miguel and Filip Christoph is left behind .
Filip is leading .
Come on , Miguel .
Pedal har .
Great .
Miguel wins the gold medal .
Good evening , Susan .
Hello Elizabeth .
I wonder if you'll watch the triathlon race tomorro .
No I'll be working tomorro .
What's more , I've no idea of what Triathlon is .
It's a combination of swimming , cycling and running .
This event tries the Racers' skills strength and willpowe .
They will churn through a 1.5 kilometer swim cycle through 40 kilometers and finish by pounding their way through a 10-kilometer run .
The Hawaii Ironman is even more grueling .
What swimming stroke are the competitors to adopt .
Any stroke is allowe .
Can the competitors get a substitute if they get a flat tire .
No .
But they are allowed to run with the bike to one of tire change stations placed around the Course trained teams then change the tire .
How will the competitor be penalized if he or she is found cutting the corner .
He or she may be warned or issued a yellow card .
Of course the offender will have to cover the corner he or she has cu .
And 2 yellow cards result in disqualification .
That sounds fair .
If only I could be free tomorrow .
Goodbye Susan .

The Chinese team was in excellent form and every player was in good condition .
Hi You look hot and Tired have you been running .

Who won the gam .
They did 3 to  .
But they just barely beat us in the very last game .
Oh .

Too bad .

Hi , Stan .
Hi , Chen .

Good news , right .
The Chinese table tennis players made a clean sweep of all gold medals in Atlanta yesterday .
They're great .
Table tennis is our national sport which gets most of the attention of the nation .
It's very popular .
This vast land has made many excellent players .
Our table tennis stars are well known . Just like you have basketball or baseball stars in America .
Including you . The former world champion .
Uh-hu .
Now I come to American studying computer science .
I have stepped down from competition for 5 years .
But you're the best qualified to coach this club .
I a .
Stan , I really appreciate you for introducing me to come here .
Don't mention it .
You know , this is only my summer job .
The new semester's coming and I have to go back .
Have you told the boss about thi .
Not yet .
I'm just thinking about this .
I think you might as well continue coaching here so that you can save some of your earnings to help meet your college expense .
That can't be bad .
I'm just curious about what kind of sports are the most popular in China .
First of all there's Table Tennis that's almost our national game .
Yes . One good thing about Ping pong is that it doesn't need space , you can play it practically anywhere .
How good are you at it . Mr. Wang .
Not very good , but I do play it a lo .
Do you like it .

Our table tennis stars are well known . Just like you have basketball or baseball stars in Americ .
Incredible .
China has won all the gold medals and most of other medals of table tennis .
It's nothing strange at all .
As for table tennis . China is the best in the world .
It's said only one Chinese player can defeat another Chinese in the final .
That's True in the final of men's single Waldner was defeated by Kong Linhu .
And all the gold and silver medals of women's single and double were won by the Chinese players .
And they won both the gold medal and the silver medal of men's double too .
Which team won the bronze medal the .
I mean men's double .
France .
But they lost to China zero-3 .
Chinese are unmatchable in chop drive push shot smash and nearly in all technique .
They are of the attacking style rather than defending .
China is the hometown of table tenni .
I suppose that may be the reason why the Chinese are so excellent at i .
But the other day I read that table tennis originated from Britain .
Really .
Is it possible .
Yes .
That article did say so I'm sur .
Frankly speaking to watch Chinese play table tennis is really thrilling .
At this Olympic I've never missed a table tennis tournament involving China .
Whenever there is such a match . Don't forget to let me kno .
Okay .
China is back on top of the women's table tennis world .
It's not strange at all .
I remember Chinese women's table tennis team has always been world champio .
If it is not so that's quite strange .
China had won the women's title 8 consecutive times before toppled in Japan by United Korea 2 years ago .
Which team did China defeat this time .
Democratic People's Republic of Korea was their victim .
What was the result in the final .
3-0 .
The Chinese women's team is so wonderful .
Yes .
They are the best in the world .
How about Chinese men's team .
They have entered the final by beating Germany 3-1 .
Which team will be China's opponent in the final .
Sweden .
They went through with a 3-1 semifinal victory over DPRK .
They are a tough opponent . They have world number 1 player , Waldne .
China is no easy team . Let's wait and see .
The Chinese men's table tennis team downed the defending champion Sweden in the final to win the team title last night at the 43rd World Table Tennis Championships .
It's so wonderful .
How was the final played .
It is the closest final I've ever seen .
The result was 3-2 .
It's a pity that I didn't watch it last night .
Can you describe the game for m .
Okay .
In the first match . World number 2 . Wang Tao , was defeated by Olympic champion Waldner .
Ma Wenge , leveled the score 1-1 after beating Persso .
In the 3rd match Chinese up and coming star Ding Song put China 2-1 up in only 15 minutes with his victory over Karlsson .
In the decisive match Wang Tao smashed Persson with his fierce attacks and excellent backhand to realize China's dream of winning back the most coveted Swaythling Cup .
It sounds like a legend .
China has own the Swaythling Cup . Many times hasn't she .
Yes .
This is the 11th time .
Who won the Cup last time .
The Swedish did .
They beat Chinese 3-1 2 years ago .
And last night's victory was a sweet revenge for the Chinese .
By the way the Chinese women's team defeated South Korea 3-0 also winning their 11th team title the day before yesterday .
What has been the biggest upset so far as the 43rd World Table Tennis Championships going .
I think the biggest upset so far is that Saive of Belgium . Number 1 in the world . Was chopped down by China's newcomer Ding son .
Really .
In which round was Saive pushed out of the game .
He was upset in the 3rd round of the men's singles .
I heard that Ding song was a chopper an excellent chopper .
You are not quite right .
He is a chopper .
But this chopping is quite different from other choppers .
His style is chopping and attacking .
Chopping and attacking .
How particular his style is .
Maybe that's why he won the game easily . Why did Saive lose the match so easily .
According to Saive's coach Wang Dayong it because he was not accustomed to ding Song's style .
Wang Dayong thought Ding Song's service was hidden and very hard to judge .
And Ding Song got many aces in the match .
How wonderful Ding song is .
At the end of the first serving Denton is beating Ronald 4 to 1 .
Yes but he won't keep his lead .
He is losing his agility his returns are becoming slower .
Well it's Ronald's turn to be serve .
Ronald always puts a lot of English on his serv .
Did you see that .
He did a backspin serve Denton didn't know how to do it .
And Ronald prefers the shakehand grip , so he can smash the ball with a backhand stroke more easily .
Good job .
The smash has earned him another poin .
Wow .
What a good pla .
Denton just hit an excellent forehand return .
He returned it so quickly that Ronald accidentally hit it on the volley .
That's a fault and a point to Denton .
Well , now it's 4 to 5 and it's Ronald's serve the last in this serving .
Oh .
Ronald confused Denton again with his serv .
He used so much back English the ball almost died when it hit Denton's half of the table .
Ronald seems to know all kinds of serve techniques the backhand topspin and backspin serves the forehand topspin and backspin serves and the high toss serves .
Denton finds it difficult to counter Ronald's attack and he hits it out .
It's 5-all tie Denton is to serve .
Well serve .
This time he bounced the ball and it just missed the net .
Ronald could only play a straight return .
They each have their own Advantages There's no way to predict who's going to win .
Let's wait and se .
Hello , sir .
Can I help yo .
Yes . Have you read about the Olympic Games of table tennis in today's newspaper mis .
Yes I have .
Can you play table tennis .
Well , yes , but only a little .
Wonderful game isn't it .
Yes it is .
I'm interested in table tennis so much that I never miss any table tennis match .
Oh .
You are crazy about table tennis .
Ye .
You see there is men's team event women's team event men's singles women's singles and Men's Doubles Women's Doubles . Mixed Doubles . We have attacking player defensive player , they get a shake hand grip penhold grip and cut chop push shot Smash take a long drive off the table fast attacks over the table combine long drives with drop shots exchange drives stroke forehead and backhand oh very much . Excellent .
That's really so sir .
Do you know what , best of 3 or best of 5 games mean .
Yes , I know , si .
The most exciting one is a seesaw match .
You are right sir .
And in the crucial game you should be serious about each stroke .
Certainly .
Now what can I show you , sir .
Oh sorry I almost forget my business .
Do you want some tennis shoes .
No , I have had tennis shoes .
Then running shoes .
No , I'd like to buy some carpet slippers like those .
Carpet slippers .
Yes .
I want to be comfortable when I'm watching television .
Hall is beating Evans 5 love at the end of the first serving .
Yes but he won't keep his lead .
He is losing his agility his returns are becoming slower .
Well , Evans is the server . Now let's see how Hall returns his serves .
Evans always puts a lot of English on his serve .
If Hall isn't agile enough this is when we'll see it most clearly .
Did you see that .
He served the ball with so much right English Hall didn't know how to do it .
Yes that's this Best Trick That's why he used the penhold grip on his paddle .
He said he could put a lot more English on the ball . I don't know whether it is true or no .
Yeah .
And Hall prefers the shakehand grips because he can smash the ball with a backhand stroke more easily .
So now we're going to see which technique is better .
Personally , I can't tell the difference between them .
My playing is so bad that it doesn't matter which grip I use .
Wow .
That was a GOOD play Evans just hit an excellent forehand return .
He returned it so quickly that Hall accidentally hit it on the volley .
That's a fault and a point to Evans .
So now it's 5-4 to Hall and it's Evans' serve the last in this serving now Hall is starting to look Worried he's losing his lead .
Wow .
Evans confused him again with his serve used so much back English the ball almost died when it hit Hall's half of the table .
Yeah . He found it difficult to return the ball after that he hit it out the umpire didn't have to think twice about tha .
So it's a 5-all tie at the end of the second serving The last time I saw Evans make a comeback , like this was in a doubles game about one year ago .
Evans and his partner took their opponents to deuce , and they stayed there for a long time before getting the 2 advantage points they needed to win the game .
Well he might do it again .
I hope so it's Hall's turn to SERVE Let's see .
Oh nice serve .
Did you see that he hooked the ball putting so much English on it that you could easily see its curve through the air and just clipped the edge of the table .
That's the first chip shot of THE GAME and we're looking at one very lucky man . It was nearly out .
And the shortest rally possible .
Let's see if Hall's luck stays . Goo .
It didn't last long . This time he played a netbal .
That's a fault and a point to Evans . They're tied again .
Yes . He tried to serve too close to the net a Little Too Close it couldn't possibly have been a let .
It was far too low .
Well Served this time he bounced the ball and it just missed the net .
Evans could only play a straight return .
It doesn't matter , they're both rallying well now .
Look at that speed Hall's certainly found his agility AGAIN This has got to be the longest rally of the game .
They can't keep this going for long .
What officials are there in a table tennis game .
Officials include an umpire service judge line umpire and scorer .
Who lays down the rules for international competitions .
The ITTF lays down the rules for international competition .
Can you explain the service rules to me .
To serve the player throws the ball straight up into the ai .
It must leave the palm of his hand .
It must then be hit at the first Attempt the bat must be behind the end of the table . The ball must then hit any part of the table on the server's side bounce over the net and hit any part of the table on the receiver's side .
How many times does each player serve .
One player serves for 5 points then the opponent serves the next 5 points .
The players alternate service until the end of the game .
Lovely weather isn't i .
Yes it is .
Are you Chinese .
Yes , I am .
Do you come to the States for traveling .
No I am not a tourist .
I'm an athlete .
I join the Olympics .
Oh really .
What's your event .
Table tennis .
Great .
My name is Grace Henderson .
Nice to meet you .
My name is Liu Wei .
Nice to meet you .
Let me introduce my husband .
Bill come here .
Right there .
Bill , this is , sorry . What's your name .
It's just on the tip of my tongue .
Liu Wei .
Oh Liu Wei .
Bill . He's a Chinese table tennis player .
How wonderfu .
Liu Wei , this is my husband .
Call me , Bill .
Nice to meet you , Bil .
Nice to meet you .
We come from Seattle .
Guess why we come to Atlanta .
I suppose you just come to watch the competitions .
You only say half of it .
We go out of our way to be here , just for cheering for the Chinese table tennis team .
That's right .
We're crazy about table tennis though we're only average players .
The Chinese team is great .
I'm so happy to hear that .
Bill and I were married . Just because we both like playing table tennis .
You keep bowling spares but no strik .
I don't know why , but I think something is wrong with my hands .
I couldn't seem to be able to control it on the first ball .
I don't think it was the problem with your hands . You did several excellent spares . You have no problem with your hands .
Then why couldn't I get struck on the first ball .
The problem is you are too nervous you want to have a strike . So much so you deliver the ball too har .
And when it comes to the second roll there's NO pressure That's why you could bowl all those spares .
Jim , how often do you come bowlin .
Not as often as I'd like to , it's so expensive here in Beijing and you often have to wait on line for a lane on weekends , so maybe only once a month .
How about yourself .
About the same .
I don't take it too seriously .
My highest score is only 135 points , which I got only once .
I usually average around 110 .
It's not the score that's important for me it's the fun .
Mine too my highest score is only 130 and like you I average around 110 .
So it sounds like it's going to be an evenly-matched game .
Good It's more fun that way .
What Ball do you roll with .
I usually bowl with an 8-ball . I like the control of a light-ball I can spin it more so that the ball hooks then I can put it just where I want it when I bowl .
Well .
I like them a little heavier .
I don't have as much control usually bowling straight . But the extra momentum compensates for that .
It's harder to bowl hook shots but I don't mind .
Last night Jeff's curves were of high level .
He even won 3 games in succession . The average scores were around 200 .
You were good to .
3 strikes at your first attempt .
Although Annie's strikes were few her spare ability was good .
Yes .
Annie's postures were graceful people who do not know her may think she is a trained bowling player .
After all , Maiga is professional origin even his opening moves are 200 scores .
I will learn some skills from him . Indeed .
Maiga , you just said that Jeff's way of play was curve Could you introduce it to me .
Jeff , you say it just as wel .
However , I can do some makeup to you .
All righ .
The curve ball is also called an arc line bal .
Generally speaking , the curve , can be divided as hook small curve and big curve .
Its characteristic is that after the ball leaves the hand it turns off in the course of its Move and moves out at a smart arc lin .
A ball generally weighs 16 pounds the angle of striking for a right-handed athlete is generally at the one-3 locations .
The European and American athletes mostly use the curve ball in international competitions .
Although curves of big arc lines are higher in rate of hit its level of difficulty in techniques is higher and it is not easy to command in a short time .
A champion of the American Professional Bowling Association used to create a record of average 254 scores in 56 games in succession . Among them , there were 2 300 scores .
He mostly used the method of the big curve whose angle of striking can reach 6 degree .
Is there any other easier method .
Yes there is .
The Asians mostly use the method of Flying Saucer the flying-saucer ball is also called peg top ball .
Taiwanese invented it , according to the body characteristics of the Asians .
Its characteristic is that the path of the ball is a straight line after the ball leaves the hand it spins vertically to the path of the ball a ball generally weighs at 10-12 POUNDS the standard angle of striking is one-3 or one-2 locations .
In actual combat it is able to have a tough fight with the curve .
Hello . Guangy .
Good morning , Daming .
Sit down , please .
Please have a cup of tea .
Thank you .
I came to ask you something about handball Can you help me .
Certainly .
Handball is very popular in Europe and it is a very wonderful game at the Olympics .
What does a handball court look like .
It's a rectangle 40 meters long and 20 meters wide including 2 goal areas .
How many Players does a team consist of .
7 including a goalkeeper .
How does a game start .
Before the game . The referee tosses a coin the team captain who wins the toss has the right to throw off and the other team captain has the right to choose end .
How long does a game last .
2 halves of 30 minutes and there is a 10 minute interval .
What skills are required of the player .
They should be skilled at running , jumping , passing catching dribbling , shooting and blocking .
Can the player take some steps with the ball .
Yes , but no more than 3 steps .
Many handball rules involve the number  .
For example , as soon as the ball is held in one or both hands , it must be played within 3 seconds or after no more than 3 steps .
What can the referee do if the player has done something against the rul .
He can hold up a yellow card to warn the player or give him a suspension of 2 minutes or even disqualify the guilty player .
I've got a rough idea of the game no .
Thank you , Guangya .
Did you manage to go to the volleyball match last night .
Yes , I was lucky . Mr. Smith gave me his ticke .

The Chinese team but it was very close .
I'm sorry I missed i .
What is called volleyball .
Volleyball is a 6 a side-court game , which is similar to badminton and tennis however volleyball is played by hand directl .
What is the object when you are playing volleyball .
To return the ball across the ne .
Does volleyball require something .
Yes of course .
Every sport has its requirement volleyball is without exceptio .
It requires speed , strength , balance stamina agility Felicity coordination and good footwork .
Is volleyball included in the Olympics .
Yes it IS it became an Olympic sport in 1964 .
What officials are there in a volleyball game .
Officials include a referee an umpire a scorer and 4 linesmen .
I have 2 questions for you .
What are they .
Something about serving .
First one is how much time does the server have after the referee blows his her whistle . And the second one .
Slow down . I'll take care of them one by one .
First after the ref blows his her whistle the server then has 8 seconds to contact the Ball and it won't be called a fault as long as he's jumped up within the 8 second .
Okay .
The second one is can a server jump forward of the end line while serving .
No problem . As long as at the time of last contact with the court . Your body was within the legal service area .
When does the volleyball match start .
It starts at 7:30 PM .
Which volleyball team is considered the stronges .
Chinese team of course .
Who is the chief referee of the tournament .
Bob stress .
Who is the captain of the Chinese team .
I think it's Sun Yue Who do you thin .
I think it's Liu Nin .
Brazil performed very well . Yesterday they were so well-coordinate .
America didn't have a chanc .
America played too loosely .
I never saw them set up perfectl .
They always seemed to be saving the ball rather than spiking it .
I think that was their back line players' proble .
Only one player of America did well at the matc .
Do you mean number 7 .
She was their best player .
Number 6 of Brazil served well .
Her underhand serve was more powerful than others .
And her spiking was equally powerful .
The team work of Brazil was admirable .
Number 11 and number 12 set up very well .
Number 5 was better at blocking than usua .
She scored 5 points in the second game simply by blocking .
Another reason for the failure of America is that they frequently made such faults as net fault and holding .
Yes , and they went overtime 3 times in the 3rd set .
Since the serves of Brazil were mostly powerful America seemed unable to organize effective attacks .
Their skill to set-up needs improvin .
However , you'll have to admit number 8 of America was good at saving she dived and managed to save the ball quite a few times .
Of the Brazilian team Jewel House is the only name I remember .
She was the Libero and was proficient at playing the role of defense specialist so she impressed me most .
Yes , her skills of passing digging and diving are outstanding .
I think you've got a good knowledge of the roles of libero now .
Thanks to the match of yesterday .
Beach volleyball was an official event of the 1996 Atlanta Olympic Games .
More and more countries are paying attention to this game .

What do you think about the standard of play of the Chinese national volleyball teams .
I think that the level of the women's national team is superior to the men's team .
In your opinion , how can we improve the skill levels of our volleyball players .
Firstly , China should organize a regional and national squad system for its top volleyball players .
Secondly , China should introduce a youth development program for volleyball . This will help to promote the sport among young people .
Thirdly , China should study the skills and techniques of teams from Cuba and Brazil on film and videotape .

Serving the ball .
Passing the ball .
Setting a pass .
Spiking sets .

What about defensive skills .
Special defensive skills include the dig , the Sprawl , the roll and the dive .
What are the different kinds of service .
There are 3 basic kinds of service the underhand serve the overhand serve and the hook serve or roundhouse serve .
Overhand serves may be played in different ways , such as the overhand floater serve the overhand spin serve and the power serve .
Which kind of serve do you recommend .
For Beginners . I recommend the underhand serve for experienced players , I recommend the overhand floater serve .
Can you explain to me the tactics of volleyball .
Before a game . The coach has a game plan but a coach should change his team's tactics during a game .
When should a coach change his tactics .
Firstly to take advantage of the opposing team's weakness . Secondly , to counter strong players on the opposing team .
And when should a coach call a time out .
A coach should call a time-out when his team loses 3 consecutive points .
When his team is playing badly or when he wants to change tactics .
He shouldn't call a time-out when his team is playing well .
How does the captain indicate a change from one team defense to another .
He indicates a change by using hand signals .
The stadium is bursting with loud cheer .
It's a pity that we're not there .
It's okay with T .
Hope our national team would regain its glories .
I hope so .
And I believe s .
But I do think your men's volleyball team should learn something from these girls , such as the spirit of fighting or anything like that .
In a volleyball match . The most important factors are our fighting spirit solidarity and unity .
We have them .
But .
What a good quick spike from a flat short set .
Sun Jiong sets the ball from Position 3 to Li Fen .
Li Fen jumps and spikes .
The ball scores a placement .
2 all .
Sun Jiong's a good setter .
It's the Chinese team's service .
Number 12 Zhou Jing is going to serve .
She serves from the baseline of position . 6 .
The overhand floater serves to position 5 .
The player at position 5 digs the ball out of bounds .
Serve again .
The cannonball service .
5 . All 7 all 8 . All 10 , all 11-al .
The championship match is really breathtaking .
Yeah .
The score rises alternatively .
A Chinese player reaches over net .
Luis is A Killer she not only spikes hard but also has tremendous spring .
She is always trouble to our defense .
Our team should closely defend her and correctly judge the opponent's intention .
The score has been so close , and many of our team are rookies .
They're under great pressure for sure .
Relax .
14 . All 15-all .
Li Fen dunks the ball quickly .
Score .
1615 .
Li Fen is different from Luis .
She's not as physically stron .
But she can use and rely on other strengths .
Right .
Luis smashes crosscourt at position 4 .
2 Chinese players erect a double bloc .
Luis hits off blocker's hand .
16-all .
Hold on .
The Cuban side makes the service The Hook float service .
When did beach volleyball become an official event of the Olympics .
That was in Atlanta 1,996 .
It was an attractive event I'm fond of it .
You'll be interested in it when you have watched one match .
How many players for each team .
Only 2 for the traditional volleyball . There are 6 .
A beach volleyball match consists of 3 sets the team who wins 2 sets is considered the winner .
How about the scoring rules .
Only the team who serves the ball can obtain one point .
That's very like the traditional volleyball . In the 1980 .
Yes .
And substitution is not allowed for the Beach Volleyball but for each 5 points . The 2 teams will change ends for instance when they are 3-2 or 5-0 .
That's interesting .
I'll watch it this evening .
Volleyball was dominated by Latin Americans in 1992 .
You mean Brazil and Cuba's gold medalists at the Barcelona Games returned home from Barcelona , just as their soccer team was defeated after they won the World Cup in 1970 .
Yes .
Brazil was given a hero's welcome when they returned home from Barcelona , just as their soccer team was treated after they won the World Cup in 1970 .
Brazil is the only team to compete in all 8 Olympics since volleyball became an Olympic event at the Tokyo Games in 196 .
This time they ousted twice Olympic champion the US in the semifinal and went on to beat Dark Horse the Netherlands in the final thus to become the first South American team to win a major world tournament .
The Cuban women's team could have become the Olympic champion earlier .
I see .
You're referring to their boycott of the previous 2 Olympics .
The Chinese women's team , which won 2 World Cups 2 World Championships and an Olympic tournament in the '80s , suffered a crushing defeat to drop to the 7th place . The lowest ranking since 1981 .
The men's squad of the Unified Team , which made its last appearance in Barcelona also ended with a modest 7th place .
Reigning world men's champion Italy just ranked 5th .
I think in the coming years . Brazil , Italy , US and the Netherlands will fight closely with each other for the men's supremacy .
What a good match we played yesterday .
I think it was our tightest playing so far .
We were so well-coordinated the other team didn't have a chance .
They played too loosely . I never saw them set up perfectly . They always seemed to be saving the ball rather than spiking it .
I think that was their back line players' problem they only had a player who could hit a good forearm pass .
Quiet .
The manger is coming towards this direction .
That was close .
Now what was I sayin .
Oh yes I think that she is their best playe .
She really served well , and she used the tennis serve , too . All the others used the underarm serve when they serve . Though they are stronger than her .
I admire her for that .
What about my serv .
I use the same techniqu .
But you're a man you're Stronger that's why you're better at spiking and slamming than me . It's why I kept trying to set you up all the time but you kept missing them .
That wasn't my Fault you always hit the ball to low .
I had to .
If it had gone too high , they would have blocked it too easily and blocking was something that they were very good At maybe the only thin .
Not true .
They were good at Playing netballs they even played a couple of netballs from their serve .
They weren't the only ones who made Mistakes . I remember the umpire gave away the right to serve of net fault you made .
I also remember the same thing happening for you but for holding the ball holding is worse than a net fault , don't you agre .
That was UNFAIR . I was just trying to slam and she gave me a fault for holding .
That slam shot was the same as all the others I'd played . I don't know why she faulted me for that one .
But it was an easy mistake to make , unlike when you went Overtime that was bad playing what happened there .
I think the volley had been going on for too long . We'd started volleying too QUICKLY . I think it was close to 30 TONS . All I could think about was returning the ball .
Then , when someone lobbed the ball . It was just too low and I dived to save i .
It really made NO difference if I hadn't faulted for an overtime the ball would have touched the court and ended the volley anyway .
Well It Doesn't Matter we won and we played a lot better than our last match .
We were always in the lead . Even from the start of the first game .
In the match before this one , we were often tied so we must be improving or our opponents are getting worse .
I think they're getting worse that match . We started with a 1-all tie .
We have also tied at 14 all until I spiked the next 2 advantage points that we needed .
We could easily have lost that Match , but this one we won easily .
Next time I think .
Well , I think that we should talk about this later , and do what we came here to do work .
Okay .
Let's get down to business .
Luis is A Killer she not only spikes hard but also has tremendous spring .
She is always trouble to our defense .
Our team should closely defend her and correctly judge the opponent's intentions .
The score has been so close , and many of our team are rookies .
They're under great pressure for sure .
Relax .
14 . All 15-all .
Li Fen is different from Luis .
She's not as physically strong .
But she can use and rely on other strength .
Right .
Luis smashes crosscourt at position 4 .
2 Chinese players erect a double block .
Luis hits off a blocker's hands .
16-all .
Hold on .
The Cuban side makes the service the hook float service .
The referee judges it's BAD 17-16 service over .
The game point now .
Hello Bingzi speaking .
Hello . Bingzi .
This is Haifang .
I called to tell you that there will be the hockey final this evenin .
But I don't know anything about hockey .
It's easy to understand its rules .
Like football . The players have in mind the aim to score by getting the ball into the opponents' goal .
How many players are there on each team .
11 same as that in football .
They compete to use their hooked sticks to push pass and dribble a small hard and generally white ball in order to score .
Hooked stick .
Yes .
A hockey stick has 2 Sides , the left side is flat and the right side is rounde .
It is only with the flat-of-the-stick that you are permitted to play the ball .
Some players have excellent stick work .
In football we have foot work and in hockey , you mentioned stick work .
An essential skill necessary for playing hockey is the ability to control pass push stop and shoot the ball with your hockey stick .
Can you use your feet to control the ball .
No .
The players are not allowed to use feet or any part of the body . Except the goalkeeper .
How can the players score .
Scoring can be done from the field goal , the penalty corner and the penalty stroke .
What are field goal penalty corner and penalty Stoke mean .
A field goal is a goal scored from open continuous play .
It can only be taken from the shooting circle a roughly semi circular area in front of the opponents' goal .
If a defending team breaks certain rules , the other team may be awarded a penalty corner .
To take a penalty corner . One attacker stands with the ball on a designated spot on the back line . The player pushes out the ball to other attackers waiting to take a shot at goa .
And a penalty stroke is a shot taken on goal by a chosen Player and defended only by the goalkeeper . The shot is taken from a spot 6.4m directly in front of the goal .
It sounds interesting .
How long does a hockey match last .
A hockey match of regulation length lasts 70 minutes . It is broken into 2 halves of 35 minutes each .
The team with the most goals at the end of the 70 minutes is the winner .
It is also possible for a match to end in a draw .
But in the matches at the Olympics . You must have a winner .
In those cases , a match which is tied at the end of regulation time then goes into extra time .
The first team to score in extra time wins and , if necessary , they may have a penalty stroke competitio .
Thank you , Haifang .
Your explanation has made me reach the decision to watch the fina .
Let's hurry . The game has already started .
Our seats are in the grandstand .
It's that gate over there .
We have to go up . These step .
I hope we don't have to sit in the su .
There is no sun in the Grandstand it's completely covere .
It's only in the bleachers where you have to sit in the sun .
Where do you usually sit .
I like to sit in the bleachers . You can see the game better .
It's cheaper and most of the real baseball fans sit in the bleachers .
Then why are we sitting in the grandstand .
It's shady in the grandstand and more comfortable for you .
Ladies usually sit in the grandstand .
Let's go down this aisle and sit behind home plate , then we can see , the pitcher better and watch how he throws his curves .
What is home plate .
Let's get a seat first .
I'll explain everything to you later .
Heavens they're already starting to play the second inning .
But the score is still nothing to nothing .
Then , we really haven't missed anything .
You don't understand .
Sometimes a game can go right up to the last inning , and the store will be nothing to nothing .
That simply means that neither team has scored a run .
There are 9 innings in a game . Aren't there .
That's right . Except that sometimes if the score is tied at the end of the 9th . They have to play extra innings until the tie is broken .
That's the pitcher out there in the center isn't it .
The fellow who is getting ready to throw the ball .
That's righ .
He's winding up .
And the player who will try to hit the ball is the Batter the player behind him is the catcher isn't that right .
You see , I know much more about baseball than you imagined .
There goes the pitch now .
The batter swung and missed .
Each batter has 3 TRIES That was his second try or strik .
If he misses again he will be out .
Those other players out the field . Who are they . Exactly .
They all belong to the opposing tea .
The man to the right of the pitcher standing near first base is called the first baseman .
The man over to the left is the 3rd baseman .
The 3 men far out in the field are all fielders .
The pitcher is throwing the ball agai .
Oh the batter hit the ball , but not very wel .
Is that a strike .
The batter hit a foul ball .
Any ball that is hit but doesn't land within the limits of the playing field is a foul ball .
Ordinarily it counts as a strike except if the batter has 2 strikes on Him then it doesn't count and the batter has another chance to hit the ball .
When does the team in the field , get a chance to bat the bal .
As soon as 3 men are put out on the team , which is at bat the side is said to be retired .
They then take the field and the other team comes in to have its turn at bat .
When the Second Team has been retired the inning is over .
The game continues in this way for 9 innings with the 2 teams alternating in the field and at-ba .
Whoever scores the most runs during the 9 innings wins the game .
The batter has hit the ball high in the air .
He has just hit a fly .
When he hits the ball along the ground . It is called a grounder .
That is the shortstop , who is going back now to catch the fly .
He has caught it and the batter is out .
Who is the man standing behind the catcher dressed in blue and wearing a pad over his chest .
That's the umpire .
He decides whether the pitcher has thrown a ball or strike .
He also decides when runners are safe or out at the bases .
He must be an important person .
How does one get to be an umpire .
According to some of the fans . Umpires are just old baseball players who have become nearsighted .
All right . Mike , we did what I wanted to do yesterday .
Today is your da .
My day I'm afraid to ask , but what do you mean .
I know there must be something special that you want to do while we're in town , such as going to Shea Stadium and .
Yeah .
I'd love to see a New York Mets game before we leave .
See .
Why don't you call the stadium and find out how to get tickets .
Hello .
Can you tell me how I can get tickets for today's game .
We're staying in Manhattan now .
There are ticket offices in Manhattan , but you can just come down to the stadium before the game and buy your tickets here .
Where's the stadium .
How can I get ther .
Are you driving .
No .
Then take the number 7 train to Shea Stadium .
It's about 10 minutes' walk form the train station to the stadium .
Thank yo .
You're welcome .
Who are the Mets playing against tonight .
The Los Angeles Dodgers .
Next .
Can I have 2 seats in the lower deck .
I got 2 on the first base foul lin .
I'll take .
Come on AMY the game's already started .
Come on .
Strike me out .
Let's go Mets .
Let's go Mets .
How many Players does a baseball team consist of .
A baseball team consists of 9 players .
Actually a team consists of more than 20 players but only 9 players are allowed on the field at one time .
How many substitutes are allowed .
There are an unlimited number of substitutes .
But substituted players cannot re-enter the game .
Where do the pitcher and the hitter stand .
The pitcher stands on the pitcher's mound the hitter , stands at the home plate .
How is a run scored .
A run is scored when a player makes his way round . All of the bases and back to home without being put out .
How many innings are there in a game .
There are 9 innings in a game .
How many outs are there in an inning .
Each team has 3 outs in an inning .
Which team bats first .
The visiting team bats first at the top of each innin .
What a victory .
We really beat them today .
Yes . I still can't believe we hit 4 runs in the first half of the first inning .
With a start like that I knew we were going to wi .
I liked the way O'Brien our opening batter started the game .
On the very first pitch of the game . He got a hit .
And what an excellent hit .
The ball went deep into the Outfield allowing him to get to 3rd base after one of their outfielders made that erro .
I remember that .
If only that outfielder had been a little slower O'Brien would have made a home run .
That was a good throw to 3rd that guy made , but it's a pity . O'Brien didn't get a homer .
Then the next batter up was Armstrong he got 2 strikes then managed to get that hit on the 3rd pitch .
I thought he was going to strike out .
Yeah , I thought he was going to be run out after he got that one .
He only got it into the infield and the infielder quickly got the ball to first bas .
Did you see the look on the first baseman's face the umpire ruled Armstrong had gotten to first base before that throw was caught .
He was easily safe .
Even I could see his foot was on base before the throw got there .
He slid into base just in tim .
My son will be playing Little League baseball for the first time this year .
Oh . Is he just starting .
My son joined a team 2 years ago .
I tried to get Joey interested when he was younger , but he didn't want to try .
He doesn't have a lot of self-confidence .
Little League is a good way to help build self-confidence .
He is too old for tee ball and most of his friends are in little league so he's willing to go for it .
I hope he gets on the team with my son .
Their coach is Andy Lewis .
He's very patient and always gives the kids , a lot of encouragemen .
Joey's a little worried because some of the other kids have been playing for 2 years and they're much better than he is .
You should tell him not to worr .
There will be other kids just starting .
He's fit right in .
How are the Astros doing this yea .
They're in first place by 2 games .
Do you think they'll be able to win it all this year .
Well , they're a pretty young team and the Dodgers are coming on strong too .
Do you come to a lot of baseball game .
Not very often only whe .

Hector I've decided to learn to play baseball for this weekend .
Can you help me with some of basic knowledg .
With pleasure .
Can you give me a brief introduction to the layout of a baseball fiel .
The field is divided into an infield and an outfiel .
The infield square has the 4 bases at its corners and it is also called the Diamond . The diamond is surrounded on 2 sides by the outfield , which is fair , territory and on the other 2 sides by foul territor .
To get a better idea of it I'll show you to the field this afternoo .
It's so kind of yo .
Where do the pitcher and the hitter stand .
On the pitcher's mound and at the home plate respectively .
How is a run score .
A run is scored when a player makes his way round . All of the bases and back to home without being put out .
How many outs are there in an inning .
Each team has 3 .
Can you explain a strike to m .
When the pitcher throws to the batter . It is a strike if he swings and misses if he hits the pitch into foul territory or if he doesn't swing at a pitch in the strike zone .
When is the batter allowed to walk .
After 4 balls .
How does the batter score a home run .
If the batter is able to circle the bases on one hit . It is a home run .
Most home runs are hit over the outfield fences around fair territory .
What are the basic individual skills of a baseball player .
It's essential for him to acquire the skills in hitting , pitching fielding accurate throwing base running and stealing bases .
How does the pitcher vary the delivery of his throws .
He uses various grips such as the curve ball the knuckle ball the slider and the fast ball .
What are the most important elements of successful batting .
The batting stance the backswing and stride the swing and contact with the ball and the follow . They are all very importan .
Ann , I didn't expect you can raise so many question .
The best way to find the answers is to play it personally .
That's the reason why I've decided to learn it from this very weekend .
Let's go out for some exercises .
That's a good ide .
Let's play some basketball .
Sorry , I'd rather not .
I don't care much for basketball .
How about playing badminton .
Yes , it's a favorite of mine .
The basket in this court is not bad , we can play right here .
But the ground is too slippery I don't wanna end up staying in the hospital after the game .
Maybe we can change one . How about the court over there .
But that ring isn't high enough . Why don't we go to the gym . I heard the badminton match was canceled .
Let's go there .
Look .
Mrs. Bell , the players are marching into the aren .
Which team is which .
The women in red are from Beijin .
The players in blue are the Shanghai team .
I'm afraid I know next to nothing about basketball .
Have you ever been to a game before .
Well , my husband likes to watch sports on TV so I have seen a few games but this is my first live game .
I'm especially excited because these are women players .
Are there any women's teams in America .
There are no professional women's teams , although there are some amateur women players .
But women's sports don't get much publicity in Americ .
Women are very active in sports in China .
Oh , yes , it's very different here .
Professional sports in America are a big business .
Oh , the game is about to star .
Oh good .
You must be sure to explain everything to ME basketball is such a fast-moving game without your help . I'll be lost for sur .
I'll do my best .
I really can't tolerate the FIBA rules too much zone .
What's wron .
I am now coaching a high school team we attended a City tournament last month and lost all of the .
Sorry to hear about that . Was it because you don't have good post players .
Sure , the tallest player on our team is only 1.85m , and they all play zone we hardly have a chance to drive the lane .
I think the FIBA rules should be abolished .
I don't think so . Look at the Nba in the NBA . If you have a great post player you can get into the playoffs . For sure , and if you happen to have 2 great post players . You'll be able to get the NBA championshi .
Too much post play in the game if you don't have good post player you won't have any chances .
The Rockets in 94-95 . The Spurs In 99 and the Lakers last year , they all have the best post players .
What about the Bulls .
Don't forget MJ was also a great post player remember the way he posted up on Stockton .
My mom just signed up my little sister for the City basketball league .
Now she thinks she is really hot .
How old is sh .
She's only 10 , but she really has the hops .
My little brother has played in that league for 2 years .
You should see him shoot the ball .
He'll take his shots from downtown and get nothing but net .
Yeah , but your brother is a lot stronger than my sister .
She can't even throw the basketball that far .
That may be true but I've seen her play .
She's tall and can really jump .
How can I become used to the ball as a beginner .
Don't worry , boy .
There are drills and exercises to help you get to know the ball .
What do you want me to begin with .
We will begin with around the body exercise .
Hold the ball in your right hand take it from the front of your waist-to-the-back pass it into your left hand then bring the ball round to the front of your wais .
Repeat this 10 times .
Then change direction , starting with the ball in your left hand in front of the waist change it to your right hand behind the back and bring the ball round to the front of your waist .
Repeat 10 times .
What's the purpose of doing these .
These are the basic skill .
Remember your first aim is not to drop the ball . And your second aim is not to look at the ball .
Pippen has won Most Valuable Player honors in NBA All-Star game .
How did he win it .
He scored a game-high 29 points for the Eastern conference he sent 5-3 point shots also made 10 rebounds and 4 steals .
Which team won the game . At last the Eastern Conference , or the Western Conference .
The Eastern Conference did with a result of 127 one hundred and 18 .
Jeez .
What a game . I love playing man-to-man defense when I can keep my man from scoring .
Yeah .
If we had been playing zone defense . I don't think we'd have beaten them by so much we might only have tied and then gone into overtim .
Oh .
I don't know . After you hit that long jump shot in the first quarter . I knew we were going to win .
Yeah .
Their play was too loose . They should have played a tighter game their defense seemed confused uncoordinated and their center didn't seem to know what their forwards were Doing those guys were all over the court .
I noticed that too . Their guards didn't seem to be guarding anyon .
Hey .
But when those guys were on the offensive . They were mean they kept cutting through our defense like we were sleeping .
But they did nothing . Once they had gotten through our defense . I lost count of the number of air balls those guys put up .
Do you remember their number 10 , putting up a shot from the free throw line in the second quarter .
Do I remember .
I was the guy blocking HIM . He threw a brick because he was trying to avoid me .
I haven't seen a brick that big since I was in junior high school that was bad playing .
What happened with that free throw you got after their guard came up from behind and hit you .
So I Missed We all make mistakes .
I'm going to have to practice my free throw shots . A little more .
Practice .
It was a Rebound you were on the free-throw line and the ball didn't even touch the hoo .
It bounced off the backboard straight onto their Possession if you'd just put it up a little softer . It might have dropped into the key so that one of our guys could have tipped it in at least we would have scored .
Hey .
We all put up bad shots and good ones too .
I also got a slam dunk in that Game that isn't what I call bad playing .
True .
That is something I have never managed to do during a game the feeling must be amazing .
So that's what you were doing .
I noticed you trying to sit in the key and wait for a pass . Were you trying to slam dunk .
No , I was just trying to be in the right place at the right time , waiting for a pass and watching the clock so that I wouldn't foul .
Did you see the basketball game last night .
Yes , can you believe it went into 3 overtimes .
I know I was on the edge of my seat .
I wish I could go to the next game , but it is out of town .
There is nothing like being in the action .
Me too .
You have to admit . The best part of the game was the slam dunk from the free throw line .
You're right .
That was quite a move .
What's your favorite sport .
I like basketball .
Do you know how to play .
Yes .
Would you like to play a game of one to one with me .
Sure , I'll go and get my ball .
What do you think of your playing in China .
I feel good .
I love this land .
People are friendly .
Fans are quite interesting and enthusiastic .
And how do you think about Chinese basketball players .
Well some young players just don't take the game as seriously as they should .
The talent is there the dedication isn't .
The same story in the States .
Did you win any award in the States .
No .
I haven't even thought in terms of me winning an award .
My main concern is with the W's and L's .
I think we all get credit when we all play well .
In the NBA . There are the NBA's most valuable 6th men .
Guys who win it are always big-time scorers .
Voters usually look at points instead of what a guy really contributes to a team .
It would be nice to win .
I don't think I'll get it .
But I do think I deserve to be in the running for it .
So what do you do in a game .
I just keep myself efficient at stopping opposing players from scoring setting up my teammates for baskets pulling down important rebounds and setting the tone for my team .
It's the team first mentality .
So your forte , so to speak is defense not scoring points .
And you like to play the on-court leadership .
That's it .
What sort of player . Do you want yourself to be .
Or what's your ideal sort of playe .
I just want myself to shoot rebound block shots pass the ball , everything .
I have the ability to change any game , because I can play 3 different positions point guard shooting guard and forward .
What about you .
Well , I want to be a coac .
Coach a team and prove it to be a major factor in the national league matches .
How do you wor .
Wherever I've played , I've always sat next to the coaches during the games listening to what they talk and taking notes .
All these help keep me focused .
I've learned a lot over the years and developed my leadership qualitie .
I've been able to provide guidance to the younger player .
Yeah .
I can see tha .
You've set a good example to your teammates .
Thank yo .
What's your favorite sport .
I like basketball .
Do you know how to play .
Yes .
Would you like to play a game of one on one with me .
Sure , I'll go and get my ball .
Do you feel like playing with one .
Sure .
I'm not very good , thoug .
That's all right .
We're just playing for fun .
Do you want the ball first .
Let's shoot for it .
Whoever gets the first basket gets the ball .
Okay . Who should shoot first .
I'm going to have to call foul on that play .
What do you mea .
I didn't fool you .
You hit my elbow . When I was shooting .
That's a foul .
You hit your elbow on my head .
If anyone fouled it was yo .
Okay . Just forget it .
You never play fair anyway .
N .
Go ahead and take your free thro .
Hello . Huajian .
Did you watch the live broadcast of the women's basketball match yesterday .
No but I've already got the result .
I didn't expect that the Chinese team would be defeated .
Nor had I .
That means they have no chance to compete for the medals . But the failure , doesn't mean the Chinese women's basketball team is inferior to the other teams in their abilities techniques and skills .
Still , I think they are grea .
I'm proud of them .
We have to admit that chance played an important role .
What's Chinese women team's best result in the Olympics .
They won the silver medal at the Barcelona Olympic Games .
They routed Cuba by nearly 40 points and reached the final .
With which team did they compete for the gold medal .
The Unified Team .
The US women's basketball team seems to be winning the gold medal .
It's very hard to predict the result .
As a matter of fact , the Australian team can rival the American team in many respects , especially in personal skills and team work .
As for the men's basketball . The American is sure to win the gold medal , isn't it .
Yes .
Undoubtedly , the so-called Dream Team has no rival since NBA professionals are not permitted to participate .
However the other teams are growing stronge .
Take Lithuania , for example , it won't be a piece of cake for America to beat Lithuania although America will win in the end .
Do you mean that the gap between the American team and other teams is narrowing .
Yes , that's the fact .
Good morning , Richard .
Morning , Philip .
Come in , please .
Would you like some tea or coffee .
Coffee : please .
Thanks .
Richard the Olympic basketball matches are scheduled to begin tomorro .
Can you enlighten me on that .
My pleasure .
What do you want to know .
Some basic knowledge .
First , could you tell me how many kinds of passes are ther .
At least 2 .
Long pass short pass bounce pass low hand snap pass shoulder pass lob pass to name just a few .
Are there as many kinds of press as pass .
N .
We have full court press half court press zone press one man press and 2 man pres .
What about the screen .
There are 5 kinds of screen forth screen back screen side screen stationary screen and moving screen .
Can you explain the 32nd rule to me .
Once a team has gained control of the ball , it must shoot within 30 seconds .
What constitutes a personal foul .
Many cases might be judged a personal Foul blocking an opponent who does not have the ball obstruction pushing charging grabbing and hand to hand contact when an opponent is shooting are among the most common personal fouls .
Thank you , Richard .
The rules are too complex for m .
If you can get me a ticket for the match . I'll take the trouble to accompany you and explain to you on the spot .
The Chinese women's basketball team put on its best-ever performance last night routing Cuba by nearly 40 points to reach the final of 25th Olympic Game .
It's wonderful .
What's the result .
179 .
It is by a margin rarely seen in women's basketball .
Which team will China play against for the gold medal .
The Unified Team .
They upset the United States by 79-73 in the other semifinal .
This is the first time that either Chinese men's or women's basketball team has reached final in a major world tournament .
What's Chinese women team's previous best result .
Their previous best result was a bronze medal at the Los Angeles Olympic Games and a 3rd place in the 1986 World Championships .
This time will be China's best chance .
Yes it is .
Cuba beat the Unified Team . In the preliminary round and we beat Cuba .
But beating their conquerors does not necessarily mean we could beat them .
I agree .
The unified team is a very dangerous rival because their centers are very strong and effective .
Our morale is very HIGH we will wait and see .
Ma Jian is going for the first Asian in NBA .
Who is Ma Jian .
He is a former Chinese basketball forward who has spent 5 years on the Chinese national tea .
Does he play basketball no .
Yes .
He is on the basketball team of the University of Utah in the United States .
How is he getting on there .
He averaged 17.9 points a game last season for his tea .
That's not bad .
How is the NBA action going this season without Michael Jordan .
It's going well .

Who is it .
O'Neal of Orlando .
He is almost taking the place of Jordan .
Is that so .
How did he play this season .
He leads the NBA with 28-5 points a game and could be the first center to win the scoring the since Abdul Jabbar in 1972 .
How about his rebounds and blocked shots .
His 12 rebounds and 3 blocked shots a game , are among the NBA best .
I suppose he is very rich isn't he .
You're quite right on this point . He is in the second season of a 7-year , $40 million contract .
He also has an endorsement deal worth at least $20 millio .
How tall is he .
2.1m .
So he is a very big man .
Yes he is , he's 135 kilograms .
He collapsed a backboard support in his first NBA appearance on television delaying the game 45 minutes .
Oh , that's so funny .
Did you watch the NBA action last night .
No , I didn't what's o .
The Dallas Mavericks lost their 19th consecutive gam .
Well , that is only one game short of the NBA record in one season .
Then who is holding the futility record of NBA .
Philadelphia set a record of 20 consecutive defeats in 1973 in the same season and Cleveland lost 24 straight games in 1982 over a 2-season span .
It is said that Magic Johnson will return to the NBA to coach the Los angeles lakers is it right .
Ye .
And Randy Pfund has been relieved of his head coaching duties , hasn't he .
Really .
How long has Pfund been with the Lakers .
2 years .
I heard that he had signed a one-year contract extension with the team through the 19 95-1,996 season .
But the boss of the club changed his mind .
He hired the Magi .
Johnson just retired from the Lakers didn't he .
Yes . He led the Lakers to 5 NBA championships in his 12 seasons with the team .
Wonderful . Then why did he retire .
He retired after learning he was infected with the virus .
Jeez .
What a game . I love playing man-to-man defense when I can keep my guy from scoring .
Yeah .
If we had been playing zone defense . I don't think we would have beaten them by so much we might only have tied and then gone into overtime .
Oh .
I don't know , but after you hit that long jump shot in the first quarter . I knew we were going to win by intuition .
Did you really .
Well their play was too loose . They should have played a tighter game their defense seemed confused uncoordinated and their center didn't seem to know what their forwards were Doing those guys were all over the court .
I noticed that too . Their guards didn't seem to be guarding anyon .
Hey .
But when those guys were on the offensive . They were mean they kept cutting through our defense as if we were sleeping .
But they did nothing after they had gotten through our Defence I lost count of the number of air balls those guys put up .
Do you remember their number 10 , putting up a shot from the free throw line in the second quarter .
Of course , I remember I was the guy blocking HIM . He threw a brick because he was trying to avoid me .
I haven't seen a brick that big since I was in junior high school that was bad playing .
What happened with that free throw you got after their guard came up from behind and hit you .
I missed the ball , it's really a shame .
I'm afraid I'll practice my free throw shots . A little more .
Don't worry you'll improve this skill as long as you practice hard let's analyze it . Okay .
It was a Rebound you were on the free-throw line and the ball didn't even touch the hoop .
It bounced off the backboard straightly into their Possession if you'd just put it up a little softer . It might have dropped into the key so that one of our guys could have tipped it in at least we would have score .
Hey .
We all put up bad shots and good ones too .
I also got a slam dunk in that Game that isn't what I call bad playing .
True .
That is something I have never managed to do during any game the feeling must be amazing .
So that's what you were doing .
I noticed you sit in the key and wait for a pass . Were you trying to slam dunk .
No , I was just trying to be in the right place at the right time , waiting for a pass and watching the clock so that I wouldn't foul .
Do you remember when the referee said you'd been traveling with the ball .
I had just tapped the ball to you after that jump ball and you'd dribbled it through their defense on your own , then the referee called a penalty and said you were traveling , he gave possession to the other team .
Yes , I was just about to pass it to our number 5 .
Let it be . We won the game and we really beat them .
Do you want to practice still more next Sunday .
Okay .
You can teach me how to hit ones from inside the key , and I can teach you how to hit the long ones from outside the 3 point line .
Okay .
Let's learn from each other and improve ourselves . You can perhaps help me improve my dribbling skills Too deal .
Deal .
How about getting the team together for a half-court bullfight .
Then if we go a few hours earlier . Maybe we can practice a little mor .
Sounds good . See you on Sunday .
Be there or be square .
The dishes are Delicious and the coffee , too . I really enjoy Them . Thank you so much .
Not at all .
Pamela .
Did you watch tv last night .
No , I didn't .
I hardly watch television .
Pamela .
I did , it's the NBA game the match yesterday was between France and Germany . It was so exciting .
Pamela .
Yes . Both teams played wel .
Actually I once thought of ringing you but I didn' .
Why .
Because it was so exciting .
All the fans shouted and clapped and cheered so much that you could hardly hear anything .
And I know how much you like basketball .
No , I Don't , I hate it .
Why .
But I remember you were very good at it in school .
I can still see you catching the ball and passing it .
And was it a long pass .
Yes .
And also short pass overhead pass and the excellent rolling pass .
But I was often foule .
Yes you used to steal the ball .
No that's intercepting .
And you once fouled because of striking .
Yes , I did .
But we boys always had good teamwork .
Now , I'm not interested in it . Listen , Pamela .
What's the matter .
You look as white as a piece of paper .
Is there anything wron .
Yes , I'm afraid . There i .
I've got something to tell you .
What .
Please call a spade a spade .
I'm very sorry I didn't bring any money on me , I can't pay the bil .
What do you usually do in your spare time Mr. White .
I enjoy playing basketball . I usually play basketball on holidays .
I think you are good at It but don't you think it's a waste of time .
I am afraid I don't agree with you .
I like doing many kinds of exercise especially playing basketball . It is good for my health as well as for the min .
More you can learn a lot from basketball .
What can we learn from it , the .
Do you know how many defenses . There are .

How many kinds of zone defense are there .
Zone Defence are 2 1-2 zone defense 3 one one zone defense 3-2 zone defense 2-3 zone defense and 1-2-2 defense or 1 defense .

I've heard of attacks . How many kinds of attacks are there .
They Are : the past break one on one payroll attack single post attack position game 1-3 one offense 3-2 Formation 2-3 offensive formation reverse post and scree .
After hearing what you said . I made a new opinion towards playing basketball .
Maybe to some extent it's a kind of art .
You are right , the players should practice more if they want to win a Basketball game . We believe that practice makes perfect .

Thank you . I must admit that I'm hungry .
Good . Let's go .
Tell me something basic about tennis .
What do you want to know abou .
How long usually does a match go on for .
It depends , but it usually takes about 2 or 3 hours .
So long .
Because usually it is best-of-3 sets . Sometimes it's best of 5 and you have to win 6 games to win one set and also every game . You have to win 4 BALLS That is why it takes so long .
Wang Ping recently I have watched Chinese TV programs and found that there are many scenes of tennis-playing is tennis very popular in China .
Of COURSE Let me tell you in the prone position the shooter lies flat on his stomach supporting the upper part of his body on his elbows the butt of the rifle is against the shooter's shoulder or shoulder blade pit and he has to hold the rifle with both of his hands .
It is TRUE Time Is developing It is not known to all that the title of the aristocrat of tennis has been taken off now . It is as convenient to play tennis as playing on the meadow .
Even so I still think tennis has its aspect of elegance because tennis pays attention to beauty in all aspects , such as tennis dress .
For me , men wear turndown collar shirts and pants and women wear short skirts . No matter if it is a man or a woman , they all dress in whit .
This dress gives a sense of beauty , which is full of youthful spirit Health and upwardness .
The athletes' movements on courts are also beautiful .
Some experts even think that tennis movements are interlinked with dance skills .
Sampras is the world number one seed for 6 years in succession his powerful service and high pressure movements . Not only have characteristics of African country dance , but also when he lifts his racket to strive for high point balls the sculpt of movements is like a statue of ancient Greece which are full of the beauty of strong manliness it has impressed thousands upon thousands of the audience .
Kournikova is a beautiful girl of the Tennis World her posture rushing to the net resembles the white Swan's posture in Swan Lake rushing to the prince happily .
When Borg 5 times , champion of the men's singles Wimbledon Championships occasionally displayed the flavor of east European folk dance in his both hands whipping backhand base line balls .
Besides athletes' service receiving attacks near the net and fish dives to save the ball all are full of poetic charms .
Tennis has become a favorite sport of the people .
A French lad said tennis is like a lover , a single touch can make my whole body and heart get excited .
Say what's your favorite sport .
It's hard to say .
I like golf a lot but I guess I like tennis better .
Do you play much tennis .
Yes , quite a bit .
How about a game sometime .
Sorry I'm strictly a spectator football , baseball , basketball , golf , I watch them all .
Did you see the tennis match last Saturday .
Who was playing .
Our favorite tennis player of course Michael Chang .
Oh yes I enjoy watching him play . I think he's really great .
How did he d .
He won , but it wasn't without a lot of pai .
Who was he playing .
He was playing against Vince Spadea .
I think Spadea thought he had won the match , and then he choked and Chang charged .
Chang must not have been playing a very good game . If Spadea was winnin .
I know that Chang has beaten him several times .
It's true . He wasn't playing his best though . The first part of the match .
I think Chang is the ultimate tennis survivor , however .
Yes he looked as if he could barely lift his feet between points but he kept scrambling until he wore Spadea down to win a match that lasted nearly 4 hours .
After the match he just paced back and forth and was unable to sit down for fear of cramping all over his body .
Wow , he really has the determination to win .
That's why I like watching him pla .
Second serve .
Yeah .
Give me a good serve this tim .
Serving is the toughest part of the game .
You just need to practice more .
I practice my serve all the time .
But always hit the net .
Maybe you should take tennis lessons .
That's what I did .
Now it's 40-3 .
Andrew serves .
Slice serve to the forehand .
Johnson returns it crosscourt deep to the right baseline Comer .
Andrew rushes to the net .
The ball has flown over his head .
Well played .
Net .
Again .
Double faul .
Advantage out .
Topspin serve to the backhand .
It breaks sharply to the backhand it's low and speedy .
Johnson uses his double handed topspin backhand drives and plays it back along the flight path of the service .
Andrew chops the ball backhand .
Johnson rushes up and makes a topspin forehand drive .
The ball hits the backcourt ground .
A good , deep crosscourt shot Johnson wins the first game .
Second serve .
Yeah . Give me a good serve this time .
Serving is the toughest part of the game .
You just need to practice more .
I practice my serve all the time .
But always hit the net .
Maybe you should take tennis lessons .
That's what I did .
What an impressive match .
It was .
It was a close match .
Venus' serve was very good and sometimes it was confusing to her opponent .
Confusing as it was Elena managed to return it with force . Most of the time .
After Venus had sliced the ball on her serve Elena had to run all over the court trying to return it .
She could only return it as a flat shot , which made it easier for Venus to slice again .
But Elena demonstrated unusual speed energy , and skills to return it .
Her performance was excellent , I should say .
Yes Venus' volley shots were hard to return .
And her skills in spin were remarkable .
Her Top Spin back spin and side spin contributed a lot to her winning of the fina .
When Venus played forehand strokes . It seemed as if Elena didn't know where the ball would go .
But in the second set the umpire called out twice when she hit the ball with a forehand stroke .
Elena is better at backhand stroke which earned her several points .
Besides , she is a master of the smash the lob and passing shots .
The final was close on each game .
The first game of the match went 15 love 15 . All 15 30-30 all and then deuce . Then it was Elena's advantage then deuce again .
But after that Venus got the 2 point advantage needed to win the game .
Even the last set was close .
The score was 6 games , all a Tie then Venus won the tie breaker to take the final set .
They are both admirable .
It's hard for me to understand the service of Tennis : Can you explain it to me .
Yes . Of COURSE the server stands behind his own baseline to one side of the center mark and he hits the ball over the net into whichever service court is diagonally opposite .
Then how about that for the first point of the game .
For the first point of each game , he stands to the right of the center mark to SERVE for the second to the left for the 3rd back to the right , and so on . Alternatel .
What's a fault .
If a service is not good . It is called a fault , which includes that the ball doesn't cross the Net or it doesn't . First hit the ground in the correct service court and so on .
If you have a fault then you will lose the serve , am I right .
I'm afraid you are WRONG . If a service is a fault . You can try one more time for the server has 2 attempts to make a good service .
What will happen if you fail again .
If you fail again you lose the point even though your opponent has not even had to return the ball .
What will happen if the second attempt of service is a good one .
If a service is good and the opponent can not return it the server immediately wins the point .
I see now . Thank you .
Becker had a really troubled time .
He lost in the first round of the Grand Slam Cup in Munich .
How could it be possible .
Who on earth beat him .
Wayne Ferreira from South Africa .
How about him .
He's a top player ranked 22nd in the world and unseeded for the Grand Slam .
But Becker is number 3 this year .
You are partly right .
He was number 3 this year , but now has dropped to number 11 .
Oh my God . He shouldn't have Dropped he's so excellent .
You know he was number 1 for 3 weeks early in 1991 and finished 1,992-ranked 5th in the world rose to number 3 during 1,993 but now .
He must be your favorite star Don't worry . Let's see the reasons his Failure . Firstly , I think that Backer's ground strokes lacked consistency and confidence his volleys were erratic and his 13 aces were nearly erased by 10 double faults , 2 straight double faults by Becker gave Ferreira , a key break in the 11th game .
Becker had also wasted 5 break points in the 6th game and he was never able to break the South African's serve .
He let go several passing shots without attempting one of the trade mark dives of old days .
Thanks Great Game .
I only won by luck : You are an excellent opponent .
No , though it was a close match you deserved to win .
Your serve was PERFECT . I was confused . Every time . By the way you Served you played 2 ace shots as well .
It might have confused you but you still managed to return it with force . Most of the time .
It was difficult at times .
After you had sliced the ball on your serve . I had to run all over the court trying to return it .
Then I could only return it as a flat shot and easy opportunity for you to slice again .
You played some as well and often spun the ball so much it nearly burnt a hole through my racket .
I think you must have been watching too many cartoons . That's the only place where you can hit an overhead shot and put so much spin on the ball that the opponent has to run for 2 kilometers outside the stadium to return it .
Your volley shots were like that you played a forehand stroke . I didn't know where the ball would g .
Yes , but most of those didn't work at all .
The umpire called out many times when I hit the ball with a forehand stroke .
So when I played those overhead power shots . I really wanted to shoot her .
So did I She did the same to me when I volleyed the ball A lot of times when I played the ball on the volley I heard her speak the word Out loudly I felt throwing her out of the stadium .
Yes I'm sure a few of those weren't faults but I said nothing . I remember when you played a netball on your first serve and a let ball on your Second Then when you played the second serve again the linesman ruled that the ball went Out of Bounds : I could have sworn that I saw it hit the Sideline . I think the linesman must be blin .
And so is the umpir .
Do you want to know what part of the way you played that I admire most .
Of course I'd like to know at once .
It has got to be your backhand stroke .
The skill you used shocked me time after time .
Well , I think I most admired the way you won the match .
When you'd won the first 2 sets . I was afraid you'd win what a straight set victor .
I only just managed to win those .
It was close on each game , the first game of the match went 15 love 15 . All 15 30-30 , all 30-40 and then deuce . Then it was my advantage then deuce again .
Yes , but after that you got the 2 point advantage needed to win the gam .
Even the last set was close . The score was 6 games , all a Tie then you won the tie breaker to take the final se .
Well , it was a good match .
Do you want a friendly doubles game sometime .
I'd love one if I can beat you again .
You hotel brochure shows there are some tennis courts in your hote .
Is it true .
Yes , we have 2 tennis courts at the back of this win .
Whom should I contact to play tennis .
Please contact that information desk at the corner of The Lobby , they can take bookings .
Can I play tennis this afternoon .
No , si .
This afternoon is fully booke .
It will be okay if it's tomorrow .
What time is available .
Any time you want .
Would you fix it at 8 o'cloc .
2 hours .
And how much is it .
I think you have a tennis racket and then the fee is $7 per person .
Do you like to play tennis .
Yes . I like it very much .
When do you play tennis .
I play tennis with my friends on Sunday afternoons .
I guess you are an expert .
No I am not .
But you're a good player , aren't yo .
Well anyway , why don't you play tennis with me next Sunday .
Why not .
But we have to rent a cour .
Do you know any court still open .
I'll let you know , over the phone . As soon as I can reserve a court .
Great .
Can I take my parents at that time .
They often played tennis when they were young .
Sure .
I'd love to see them .
Thanks .
Great game .
I only won by luck you were an excellent opponent .
No : It was a close match but you deserved to win .
Your serve was PERFECT The way you served the ball confused me every time you played 2 ace shots as well .
It might have confused you but you still managed to return it with force . Most of the time .
It was difficult at times .
After you had sliced the ball on your serve . I had to run all over the court trying to return it .
Then I could only return it as a flat shot and easy opportunity for you to slice again .
You played a few as well .
You often spun the ball so much .
It nearly burnt a hole through my racket .
I think you've been watching too many cartoons . That's the only place where you can hit an overhead shot and put so much spin on the ball that the opponent has to run for 2 kilometers outside the stadium to return it .
Your volley shots were like that you played a forehand stroke . I never knew where the ball would g .
Yes , but a lot of those didn't work .
The umpire called out so many times when I hit the ball with a forehand stroke .
And when I played those overhead power shots . I wanted to shoot her .
Yes , she did the same to me when I volleyed the ball A lot of times when I played the ball on the volley . I heard the word out shouted , I felt like throwing her out of the stadium .
Let's go out for some exercise .
That's a good idea .
Do you like to play tennis .
It's my favorite sport .
Do you play ofte .
At least twice a wee .
Are you a good playe .
No , just an average playe .
What about you .
Are you good at tennis .
I am a very poor hand at tennis but I am very fond of it .
Okay . Now let's go to the court and have a match .
It's out .
It was almost in , but it's definitely out .
Are you sure .
From my angle that shot looked goo .
It's hard to tell . I really think the ball was out .
Well , I really think the ball was in .
Okay . How about if we just serve the ball over again and replay the poin .
Yeah , that sounds fair to me .
The service of tennis is too complex for me to understand .
Yes . The service and scoring rules are difficult to me too .
But I happen to know the basic rules of service .
The server stands behind his own baseline to one side of the center mark and then hits the ball over the net into whichever service court is diagonally opposit .
How about that for the first point of the gam .
For the first point of each game the server stands to the right of the center mark to serve for the second to the left for the 3rd back to the right , and so on . Alternately .
What's a fault in tennis .
If the ball doesn't cross the Net or it doesn't . First hit the ground in the correct service court . It is a faulty servic .
The one who makes such a fault is to lose the right to serve , isn't he .
No he will serve once more .
If he fails again .
Double fault leads to the server losing the point , even though his opponent has not even had to return the ball .
If the second attempt is successful and the opponent failed to return it the server wins the point .
I see .
I have another question to ask you . Mr. Li .
What is it .
When I watch a tennis match on TV I often heard Let and I wonder what a let is .
If the service ball touches the net but still goes into the correct service court . It is called a let This means that the service is taken again .
What will happen if it was the first attemp .
If it was the first attempt . The server still has 2 attempts to make a good service .
Thank you for your explanation .
Please don't stand on ceremony .
The scoring system in tennis is confusing .
Yes .
But in fact it is quite simple .
However , I don't know about i .
Don't worry . Let me make it clear for you .
In each game , a player begins with no score called love . The first point he wins in the game gives him a total score of 15 The second brings the total to 30 , the 3rd to 40 after this . The next point wins him the game unless his opponent also reaches 40 , in which case one of them has to get a 2-point lead to win .
Jennifer Capriati , the new tennis star lost in the opening set at US Open .
Who beat her .
Leila Maskhi from the Republic of Georgia .
It is said that Capriati is 7th seeded at the US Open , isn't she .
Yes .
She i .
This loss may be the worst one of her caree .
This is the first time Capriati has fallen in the opening round of a Grand Slam event .
What's her age .
17 .
She is still Young she's a promising player .
I often hear people talk about Michael Chang How about his playing .
He was the youngest tennis player ever who won the French open He was only 17 .
That's quite an achievemen .
Not only THAT : he has been in the second place in the world rankings .
I wonder why he's so popular in Asia .
It's not difficult to understand .
You see he's Chinese and he's lean and short when compared to most other to players like Sampras and Agassi and yet he's able to outmatch them in some games .
He's the hope of many people who like him being not athletic and tal .
I agree .
Watching his game is never boring .
You see him doing his best to chase after the ball .
We can almost feel his explosive energy just watching him play .
That's why so many people like to watch him Play , a lot of them can identify with him : Too bad we don't have many tennis courts in Hong Kon .
Yes we do .
The government has been opening quite a few new tennis courts in recent years .
Yeah . But still , you have to book a place in advance .
Even so , it's better than nothing .
We have a popular saying in our country all work and no play makes Jack a dull boy .
We all believe that everybody needs recreation .
We cannot work all the time . If we want to maintain good health .
You're quite right .
I think everyone has his own way of relaxing .
Perhaps the most popular way is to participate in sports .
When I was young for recreation , I liked to play tennis in the summer .
My favorite winter sport was skiing .
You also have a favorite sport . Don't you .
Yes , my favorite sport is badminton .
Sometimes I also play table tennis or go swimmin .
Many people enjoy sporting events , but they do not like to participate in them .
Chess card playing and dancing are forms of indoor recreation enjoyed by people old and young .
Are you a good dance .
Not quite .
At my age I like joggin .
I think it is a very good exercise .
It's a pity . I haven't had much time for exercise lately .
I'm afraid I am putting on weigh .
That serves as a timely warning .
You must try your best to reduce weight .
How many people can play a game of badminton .
Badminton can be played by 2 people in singles or by 4 people in doubles or mixed doubles .
How does a game start .
The players spin a Racket The winner of the toss has the right to serve first .
The loser has the right to choose ends .
How long does a game last .
There is no definite playing time .
Generally speaking , a game is won by the first player to reach 15 points for men and 11 points for women .
How many games are there in a match .
A match consists of the best of 3 games .
Good evening , ladies and gentlemen .
Shall we begin .
We're very honored to have Mr. Li Heng and his coach , Mr. Tian Bingyi with us tonight .
As we all know Mr. Li has just won the badminton championship .
The conference will last 30 minutes .
If you have any questions , do not hesitate to ask them .
Mr. Li Heng I'm from the local newspaper The Weekly Post .
I'd like to ask how you feel at the moment .
First , I'd like to give my special thanks to the Chinese Badminton Association and my coach Mr. Tian .
They've arranged this news conference for me .
In the final tonight . I've beaten Mr. Larsen of Denmark and win the championship title .
This is a breakthrough , not only to myself but also to my teammates .
Here I must say this medal hanging on my neck is very heavy , I must owe half of the medal to my coach Mr. Tian .
It's he who makes this medal possible .
He not only teaches me techniques , but also gives me the right directions on my way to grow up .
I'd like to know something about badminton game . First , can you tell me about the service .
Sure , I will .
The service is a diagonal shot hit into whichever service court is diagonally opposit .
It is not taken from the baseline , but from the server's own service court .
How about the serving order then .
In singles one player serves until he makes a faul .
The serving court is always decided by the server's scor .
If his score is even he serves from his right hand court if odd from his left .
In doubles one player serves until his side makes a Fault he changes court for each point but the receivers do not on the first fault by the serving side in a game the service passes to the other side but thereafter both partners in a side have service opportunities before the service passes to the other side .
It's so complicated in double .
Then how to call the scores in a badminton matc .
As in tennis . The score is called after each point and the word love is used for a 0 scor .
Do they change ends in the match .
Yes they do .
Sides change ends after each game and also half way through the 3rd game .
The change in the 3rd game occurs when the leading side reaches 8 points in a 15-point game , 6 points in an 11-point game .
What will they do . When the score reaches 13-all .
If the score gets 13 tied the side that reaches 13 first may choose to set the game to 5 when the game is set the score reverts to love all and proceeds to 2-3 or 5 as decided .
But the final score is recorded as the total number of points scored in the game .
Indonesia is really a powerhouse of badminton .
How come .
They have clinched all 4 semi final berths for men at the famous $125,000 All England Open .
Who are the 4 entering the final 4 .
Top seed Ardy world silver medalist Susanto Olympic champion Kusuma and defending champion Arb .
Why did their top player Suprianto fail to make the final 4 .
Oh not fail . But because of his shoulder injury he didn't come .
Who won the title . Anyhow .
The defending champion Arbi succeeded in retaining the trophy .

Damn it .
The shuttlecock stopped short in its flight and plunged down into my court .
You should run to return it before it hits the ground .
Now hit it Sharply Downward How can I return such a strong shot .
Okay .
Attention please .
I'll let it fly in a high arc and then fall gently this time now hit it forcefully Ah Ya .
I didn't miss it . The frame of my racket touched it .
That's wrong . You should not let the frame hit the shuttlecock .
Good morning . Country Clu .
May I help you .
Yes . Can I have a badminton court this afternoon .
I'm afraid we don't accept telephone reservation please come over to make your bookin .
I see .
Can I ask if there is any court free this afternoo .
Badminton cour .
That's right .
Ye .
There's one available this afternoon .
Thanks a lot .
Can I have a badminton court at 3 pleas .
Let me see . I'm sorry that the courts are fully booked today .
Wha .
That is too bad .
Do you have any court tomorrow then .
Yes we do .
We have 3 and 5 in the afternoon .
Ji Xinpeng is an excellent shuttler .
The way he kept returning the shuttle really impressed me .
Yes .
He is incomparable in many respects serving volleying swipe and Smash .
In the final Ji Xinpeng and Hendrawan rallied for about 20 turns before Ji Xinpeng scored one poin .
Thrilling .
The shuttle flew so quickly that I could hardly keep its track and both the players displayed their outstanding speed stamina and agility .
They are both good at serving .
The way they dropped the shuttle onto the racket is perfect .
But I remember Hendrawan served it out one time , and he had to pass the serve to Ji Xinpeng a couple of times because he hit a couple of net shots when he tried to swipe .
Homer sometimes nods .
But Hendrawan is excellent at playing overhead strokes and Underarm strokes .
It was really a wonderful match .
If only I could watch them play again .
The Thomas Cup and the Uber Cup . The most coveted team competition will be held on May 12 , 21 .
How is the Chinese badminton team prepared for the 2 cups .
They are training hard .
Head coach said that though Chinese players are young and inexperienced . Now they will prove to be a major factor . Later , he has a lot of confidence in the .
How are the teams grouped this time .
China is in Group A with top seed Indonesia unseeded Sweden and finland Group B consists of second seed Denmark defending champion and 3rd seed Malaysia , South Korea and Thailand .
How will the champion be decided .
The top 2 in each group will advance to the Final 4 with the Group A winner playing the runner-up in Group B and Group B winner taking on the Group A runner-up .
What do you expect the results of the 2 cups .
According to Li Yongbo for the men making the final 4 will be a big victory for the Chinese and making the final problem for them to retain the Uber Cup .
Can you say something about Li Yongbo .
Fine . He's a young coach in His '30s He was former world men's doubles champion .
What did he do after he became head coach .
He made a big reshuffle with the Chinese national team after taking over . Not long ago , causing a stir in badminton circles inside and outside China .
What did he say about it .
He said what he had done with the team had proved to be good so far .
Do you know what are the main international badminton competitions .
Yes .
The main international competitions are the All England Badminton Championships the Thomas Cup and the Uber Cu .
When were the first All England championships held then .
They were held in 1899 .
Well , they have a long history , aren't they .
Yeah . But it has been only 8 years since Badminton was included in the Olympics .
Really .
Well let me calculate yes 8 years ago so it became a full Olympic sport in 1992 .
That's right at the Barcelona Olympics in 1992 .
What do you think of the standard of the top Chinese badminton players .
I think they are among the best in the worl .
However , we should not be complacent and should always try to improve standards even mor .
Meanwhile , China should have a development program for young player .
Do you know why badminton is so strong in Indonesi .
Yes .
Badminton is the major sport in Indonesia .
The country has a long tradition in the sport and pays much attention to the development of badminton .
I think badminton must be the most popular sport in Indonesia .
So do I .
But it is also very popular in China .
We can often see people play this game in front it their houses or on the playground .
They usually play in singles .
It is very convenient to play in this wa .
So it is .
I think badminton is great FUN . It is fast and tricky .
Yes , and it's physically demanding too You can be easily exhausted . If you're not in a good shape especially when you play single .
I see .
I never prefer to play single running back and forth and smashing are killing me .
But you see the trick of playing a sport well is trying to outwit you opponen .
If your opponent is tall and strong , you have to play it wisely .
Say what's your favorite sport .
It's hard to sa .
I like badminton a lo .
Are you good at i .
Yes , quite good .
How about a game sometime .
Sorry , I just like to watch almost all kinds of ball games football , baseball , basketball , golf , I'm strictly a spectator .
You mean you never do anything yoursel .
Well , I only like to do some jogging in the fresh-morning air .
You are an early bird then .
It was fun . Thanks .
So was It you're and excellent opponent The way you kept returning the birdie and kept the rally going really impressed m .
I think we rallied for about 20 turns at point during the gam .
Closer to 30 turns . I think that rally exhausted me and you were the one who ended i .
What do you mean .
You missed the birdi .
It was because of your excellent playing .
But it was your serve , so unfortunately I didn't get a point .
Those are the rules of the game , the server gets the POINT and it was my turn to serve .
Servers are something you are good At The way you drop the birdie onto the racket is perfect .
And the way you always hit it just below your waistline looks so professional .
But I did make one Mistake I remembered serving it out one time , I also passed the serve to you a couple of times because I hit a couple of net shots when I tried swiping .
I'm not too good at swiping Either I often swiped the birdie into the net . Just as you did .
I think I'm better at playing overhead strokes and I felt more confident using a forehand overhead stroke than a backhand on .
It always goes out if I use the backhand overhead stroke .
I'm the same with underarm strokes , especially my underarm forehand stroke .
Each time I had to use it to save the birdie went to high you easily smashed it back .
I love playing those You can aim the birdie close to sideline .
And the feeling when it hits the court and the umpire says it was in is great . It is the best of the game .
And when he says it's out my feelings got troubled fortunately I didn't get too many faults in that match . So I was happ .
Well , it was a close match but you deserved to win . And you did .
No , I thought you would .
We were tied from the Start the score quickly went to a 1-all tie . Then 2 one then we were tying again at 2-all .
At the end of the game as well . We were on deuce for quite a while . First , you got the advantage point then I won the next point to take it back to deuce agai .
I only got the 2 advantage points I needed by luck either of us could have won .
Would you like a doubles game sometime .
Okay .
But I don't know who I could ask to be my partner . I'll ask Michael then we can have a mixed doubles GAME . All righ .
Remember to give me a call .
I hear the final of women's single of badminton is to take place this evening at 8 : Who are the 2 player .
Guo Zhichao from China and Camilla Martin from Denmark .
You know Dora . I know nothing about badminton .
Will you give me some information and answer some of my questions .
I'd love to .
Asian countries such as China , Indonesia and Malaysia have the best shuttlers .
They have consecutively won the medals at the Olympics .
I guess , Ms Gong Zhichao from China is most likely to be the winner in the final .
What are your questions .
First , I'd like to know something about the service .
In singles . The server begins in the right service court and serves to his or her opponent in the opposite right service court .
If the server wins a rally he or she scores a point .
The next serve is from the Left service court .
A player can only win points when he is serving .
What are the basic skills for playing badminton .
I think the players should be skilled at serving volleying the backhand smash the forehand smash and the drop sho .
Do the players change end .
Yes , they change ends after each game and also half way through the 3rd gam .
How many points is the winner to get before one set ends .
As for double and men's single that's 15 As for women's single that's 11 .
I remember that you've once mentioned foot fault .
What is it .
Neither the server nor the receiver can move his or her feet until the server's racket has hit the shuttle .
If one moves he or she will be judged to have committed a foot fault .
I once heard the expression 5 to love or something like that . What's the meaning .
That's 5 to zer .
In sports . Love means ni .
Interesting .
That was fun . Thank .
Me Too you're an excellent opponent The way you kept returning the birdie and kept the rally going really impressed me .
I think we rallied for about 30 turns at one point during the game .
Closer to 40 turns . I think that rally exhausted me and you were the one who ended it .
What do you mean .
You missed the birdi .
Because of your excellent playin .
But it was your serve , so unfortunately I didn't get a point .
Those are the rules of the game , the server gets the POINT and it was my serve .
Serves are something you are good At The way you drop the birdie onto the racket is perfect .
And the way you always hit it just below your waistline looks so professiona .
I did make one Mistake : I remember serving it out one time , I also had to pass the serve to you a couple of times because I hit a couple of net shots when I tried to swipe .

It often goes out if I use the backhand overhead stroke .
I'm the same with underarm strokes , especially my underarm forehand stroke .
Each time I had to use it to save the birdie went to high you easily smashed it back .
I love playing those You can aim the birdie close to sidelin .
And the feeling when it hits the court and the umpire says it was in is great . It is the best of the game .
Hello Joh .
Where are you coming fro .
From a football match .
The London team played against the Oxford team .
And what's the scor .
2 to 1 in favor of the London team .
How is it that so strong a team as the Oxford team lost to the London team .
The London forwards were in excellent form and their goalkeeper did his job splendidly .
Were there some other causes that led to the loss of the Oxford tea .
One of the Oxford team's best players was injured and was replaced by another who proved to be a poor makeshift .
What a pity .
Who acted as the refere .
Bob Smith did .
He knows his job . All right .
It was the London team that opened the score and the score remained to be 1-0 until the very end of the first half when the Oxford team scored its first goal .
As I understand , the first half ended in a draw .
Yes , it did .
During the second half . The Oxford team's half back who was at fault was ordered off the field , and thus the Oxford team had to play against the London team with its 10 players .
When did the London team score the second goa .
Towards the end of the second half .
When one of the players of the Oxford team was at fault . The referee suspended the game and ordered a penalty kick .
And that penalty kick brought the London team another score .
Right you are .
There are more professional football clubs in England than anywhere else in the world .
There are 4 divisions in the English league system .
Well , a few years ago . Bristol City Football Club was in the First Division . Now they're in the 4th Division .
The biggest problem's financ .
I believe 3 or 4 years ago . This club paid a quarter of a million pounds for a player and the team that is playing now for the city are all players that have cost no money .
They're all what we call free transfers .
And that's the biggest difference that we can't go and buy quality players .
We've got to get people that cost nothing and try and get a successful team doing it that wa .
We've got a lot of young players and my job is to encourage them and get them to play .
So what direction .
I mean what are your immediate aims for the group .
Well , we're there alread .
We're top of the 4th division at the minute .
It's a bit early in the season but if we can stop in the top 4 of the 4th Division and get promotion for the club .
We're getting great crowds no .
We had nearly 11,000 here Tuesday night which is fabulous .
That's bigger crowds than Second Division teams are gettin .
At the minute . The club is bubbling it's been through a bad TIME it's it's had a big crisis .
We think we've sorted the finance out we're trying to live within a tight budget and get success which is Difficult . But at the minute . We're on the up and we've got to keep going that way if possible .
Can I ask you , what you think about the club's situation .
Well , I think the past 15 months we've been getting through the Problems It was 1518 months ago that we took over the problems .
And these were problems which had occurre .
A classic case really of a club which and success and then quickly came to failure .
And they left behind long term contracts high wages for a club that had failed and removed themselves from the first division right the way down to the 4th division and no way could they pay their way .
And then we had to take drastic steps and these were in fact to get rid of those long contract players who had very high wages .
And that was the point at which this club turned round : It was very unhappy at the time .
There's nothing worse than getting rid of players . You know who had given this club , good service .
We had a new board new people came throug .
We set up a consortium , whereby we could sort out the debts of the old club .
And through sort of through good management . I think we've been lucky to get a good manager . We've managed to turn the whole thing round .
And right at this moment . We're sitting right at the top of the 4th division . I know it's the 4th of 4 divisions , but we're going the right wa .
So where do you see the club a year from now .
Good question .
If I had a crystal ball , you know , I could tell you exactly .
But I feel very confident that we are going to make it this year from the 4th to the 3rd .
One would hope that this time next year . We're right at the top and moving into the second divisio .
And then , believe me the big problems start because once you're in the Second Division . You want to go into the first division and then we're back where we starte .
The big money comes back into it , then how can we afford these players .
And when you get into the First Division you're competing with the Manchester United and the Liverpool the big clubs , you know , and it's very difficult .
But we're a big cit .
There's no reason why we shouldn't go back there .
The best of luck .
Thank you very much .
Did you go to the football match last Saturday .
Certainly .
It was the first match of the season .
What did you think of it .
Very exciting .
Which team did you root for .
I've always supported Liverpool .
Me too .
Does anybody want to go to the football match this afternoon .
I've got several spare ticket .
They are good ones too . For the grandstand .
I'll com .
Where is the match being held .
At Chelsea football groun .
Is it far .
No , we can go by tube .
It's only a few stops from South Kensington . On the District Line .
Who's playing .
Chelsea versus Manchester United .
Count me in .
I'm a Manchester supporter are you coming Kayed .
No , I can't .
Janet and I have to go to the airpor .
Her parents are arriving from the States this afternoon .
I wonder if Gao Hongbo is playing .
Who's Gao Hongbo .
He's Guo an's top scorer .
He got a back injury . A few weeks ago and hasn't played since .
There he is .
Great .
He's a brilliant playe .
It's worth coming just to watch his footwork .
I hope he's on form today .
Hey , look : The police have made a no-man's land to keep the 2 groups of fans apart .
Is that really necessary .
Yes , they sometimes get very violent .
They're kicking off .
Who do you want to win . Pat .
Since I'm with 2 Shen Hua supporters I'd better join You . I don't want any violence .
Core Jia is the goalie for Shen Hua .
I don't think Guo An stands a chance against such a strong team .
Did you see tha .
What a kick .
From one end of the pitch to the other .
Oh no . Guo an's got the ball .
Come on Tang Min take it from them .
The referee has stopped Tang Min .
Oh Fou .
That means a penalty kick for Guo An .
They've scored . It's a goal .
Don't worr .
I'm sure Shen Hua will win .
They haven't warmed up yet .
Look , Tang Min's got the ball .
Come on Tang min .
What a beautiful pas .
He's fallen oh no .
It's his back again . He's out of the game .
Do you still think Shen Hua will win .
We lost a game last night . What a pity .
What went wrong .
Because they made too many bad passes .
Bad passes . Can you be more specifi .
They were passing when trappe .
Too bad the defense would know where your limited pass options were .
Right What can I do to motivate them to be better passers .
What do you wanna do about this .
Should we run suicides for making bad passes .
I don't think punishment will help bad passes .
The best way is to let them understand the importance of making a good pass , let them know that good passes are more important than elegant dribbling .
If you can do that , it's much better than any punishment .
Deng Jun's thrusting down the middle .
He dribbles past a fullback .
He's tripped .
The Diamond number 7 , plays that rough .
Deng Jun seems hacked .
Number 7 , has been given a yellow card .
He pays for it .
A free-kick near the penalty area .
The goalkeeper organizing to build up a wall .
Deng Jun takes the kick .
What a beautiful banana shot .
It bends around the defensive wall and flies into the net from the top left-hand corner .
1-all .
Deng Jun is grea .
Which 2 teams are playin .
China , versus Japan .
Who's taking the lead now .
The Chinese team overpowers its counterpart 2 to 1 .
So it's in the favor of the host team now , but the scores have been rather close .
Look what a beautiful heading .
The teamwork of the guest is really wonderful .
Who do you think will win .
I figure . They've got a 50-50 chance .
According to the papers the visiting side is a strong team in Europe .
I thought the local team's going to lose .
The same to me .
The local team's defense seems to be well organized and the visiting forwards were asleep in the second half only their left half plays rough . Therefore , there were some bad misses .
That's it . The local team looked enterprising from the first minute of the kick-off . I think 2 to one , didn't do them justice .
What time is it now .
It's half past  .
When will the football finals begin . Do you know .
At 6 o'clock sharp .
It must be very exciting . I think .
Yes , I think so .
Have you got any tickets .
I have just one ticket .
You are lucky , I have to go and watch TV .

How is a foul committe .
If a player trips kicks strikes obstructs or holds an opponent he's committed a fou .
What's the penalty for i .
If it's merely a minor offense . The referee may award a free kick .
For an intentional offense the offender may be shown a yellow car .
But if he repeats it intentionally he may be shown the Red Card . Then the player is sent off the field .
Do you think it's a good means to curb violence on the football fiel .
To some extent . Yes .
When is a penalty kick awarded .
That's when a serious foul is committed inside the penalty area .

They hope the joint sponsorship of World Cup would promote closer ties with DPRK .
Japan also has announced plans to bid for the 2002 World Cu .
Has any Asian nation ever been host to World Soccer's major events .
No , no Asian nations have .
And I think there's little hope for these countries to bid for the 2002 World Cup successfully .
Do you really think so .
Don't you think Japan is qualified to host it .
Maybe Japan together with Korea will bid for the World Cup later .
I want to make a bet with you , will you accept it .
WHY NOT deal .

Who else was injured .
Signori .

What are the referee's responsibilities .

Then how is a foul committed .
A foul is committed if one player trips kicks strikes obstructs or holds an opponen .
How can a referee penalize a player .
Can he send off the player .
For a minor offense . The referee may award a free kick .
For a first bookable offense a referee can show the Yellow Card for a second bookable offense he shows the player the red card to send off the field .

America takes the 4-3-2 formation , while Germany takes 4-4-2 .
America seems more aggressive .
I see .
Is number 9 . The player you admire most .
Yes . Norbert is the point man in the midfield and the strike .
Germany is sure to mark him closely .
But he has his own way .
There , Willia .
The American forward number 3 goes around a defender .
He centers the ball to the right side of the penalty area .
Nice pas .
Another American forward is penetrating fast .

They all challenge , to head the ball .
The goalkeeper punches the ball away .

America lacks punch in the midfield .
Norbert Norbert is thrusting down the middle , he dribbles past a fullback .
.
He's trippe .
The German number 10 plays that rough .
He should be shown a yellow car .
That's it he pays for it .
A free-kick near the penalty area .

Norbert takes the kic .
What a great shot .

That's quite right .
I hope he could have greater achievements .
Sure .
Let's wait and see .
What do you think about the standard of play of Chinese national football team .
I think it is very low .
There are many shortcomings of Chinese soccer aren't there .
Yes .
Firstly it is lack of basic football skills .

Well , there's a long way to go for Chinese national football team .

Has it ever been canceled due to some reason .
No .

They don't often have a bad day this yea .
Which team do you suppor .
I've always supported Argentina .

You are right .

Goodbye .
Bye .
What a big crowd .
There must be 20,000 people here .
It's lucky for us to have reserved seats .
Where are our seats .
Row A number 16 to 18 .
That's right , in the front .
We'll have to push through the crowd to get to them . Excuse me . Excuse me , do you mind , sorry , excuse me . Well , here we are at last .
What splendid seats .
We'll be able to see everything from here .
Yes .
Deng Jun has certainly looked after us well .
We'll have to take him out to dinner after the match .
Good idea . Liu Yin we certainly must .
Just for celebrating the victory .
The Boss team needs to beat the Diamond team to get passes to the final .
But the Diamond only needs a dra .
So it will make or break the BOSS team .
As the captain of the BOSS team Deng Jun feels the pressure .
Don't worry .
I told him he must play hard because his better half is watching him .
You mustn't talk nonsense like that .
Here are the teams coming out .
Deng Jun , is leading the BOSS team .
Deng Jun lost the toss and the Diamond captain has decided to play with the wind .
Oh well , they'll have to play against the wind in the second half .
Deng Jun is playing center forward .
He's just getting ready to kick off .
There they go .
Come on boss .
Hello John . Where are you coming from .
From a football matc .
The London team played against the Oxford team .
And what's the score .
2 to 1 in favor of the London team .
How is it that so strong a team as the Oxford team lost to the London team .
The Londoners forwards were in excellent form and their goalkeeper did his job splendidly .
Were there some other causes that led to the loss of the Oxford team .
One of the Oxford team's best players was injured and was replaced by another who proved to be a poor makeshift .
What a pity .
Who acted as the referee .
Bob Smith did .
He knows his job . All right .
It was the London team that opened the score and the score remained to be 1-0 until the very end of the first half when the Oxford team scored its first goal .
As I understand , the first half ended in a draw .
Yes , it did .
During the second half . The Oxford team's halfback , who was at fault was ordered off the field , and thus the Oxford team had to play against the London team with its 10 players .
When did the London team score the second goal .
Towards the end of the second half .
When one of the players of the Oxford team was a fault the referee suspended the game and ordered a penalty kick .
And that penalty kick brought the London team another score .
Right you are .
What's your favorite sport .
Football , of course .
Today , it's probably the most popular sport in the world .

How long have you been playing soccer .
I've been playing soccer for 5 years .
Could you teach me how to play .
Certainly .
Man , this place is big .
It has to be .
Soccer is the number one sport throughout Europe .
In the states we have The Big 3 baseball , football and basketball . But there's only the big one here in Europe soccer .
Can you play soccer Evan .
I never have .
I think my high school had a team but I went out for baseball .
Did you join any sports teams in school , Kath .
In high school , I went out for track the 400 and 800 meter run .
Wow .
Those are tough race .
Yeah .
That's probably why I didn't do very well at them .
It's more important to enjoy the game and get stronger from sports than to perform well in them .
Were you a good baseball player .
I was so-so .
Anyway , let's exercise a little .
Hello , Tom .
Do you want to go to the football match with me tonight I know football is your favorite spor .
Here's a ticket to Spare . It's also a good seat in the grandstand .

You know I'm a Brazil-Supporter . I do hope Romario is going to play tonight .
You are too excited . Tom .
Don't worry , you'll find out him in the game . I hear he's one of key scorers on the Brazilian team .
But what I'm interested in most is who will win the Olympic Games .
We can imagine all the players going to their best , but I hope Brazil will win the game , it must be a wonderful game .
Let's go earlier after supper .
I agree .
I can't wait to see the gam .

Surely .

They have the rental clubs costing $7 per full set . But I'm not sure about the shoes .
Let me check it again on booking .
I wonder if I got your names and room number .

Yes .
Mr. Wang Mr. Lin and my name is Jack Lee staying in Room number 1,245 .
Thank you very much and I'll leave a message about the rental shoes .
Do you like gol .
I have never tried gol .
I heard it is a sport for the Noble . It is very expensive .
But I'm sure it is a very special game .
I know .
But I have good news for yo .
In order to promote its real estate the golden star resort village will open its golf court free for 3 days , beginning from Christmas Da .
Wonderful .
Where can we get the tickets .
Is it too late .
Don't worry .
I've already got the tickets .
They are on December 27 Would you like to go .
Would I like .
I can't wait for the day .
What did you get on that last hole . Joh .
I got par .
It's the first par I've had all game .
Did you remember to add a stroke for going out of bounds .
Oh I forgot about that .
I guess I got another bogey .
Well that means we're still tied .
Do you want to wager a little money on the next hole just to make things interesting .
I hate landing in the sand tra .
Now I'm probably going to waste strokes in getting it out .
At least you haven't landed in the water ye .
I've done that on the last 2 holes .
Could you hand me my wedge .
Here you go .
I'll wait for you to get on the green before I put .
No , you go ahead and put out .
Then I'll go .
No way . Mary .
I'm going to let you go first .
I don't want the pressure of going first .
Is there anything new today .
Yes the world women's 5,000 meters record is broken .
Who broke it .
I don't know , but she is a new one and runs much faster .
When was the Yangpu gymnasium completed .
In 1984 .
What's the seating capacity of this Gym .
It can hold 6,000 spectators .
Are there any major competitions held there .
Yes there ARE . It has been used for the 5th National Games Asian Basketball Tournament in 1988 and many national basketball competitions .
Is it convenient for spectators to go there .
Sure . It is located in the center of Yangpu District spectators can take number 90 and number 77 buses to the gym .
It looks new by its appearance .
Yes it was renovated in January . 1998. it is ready for the 1st East Asian Games .
The 6th . Far East & South Pacific Games for the disabled Closed as the host country how had you prepared for the FESPIC .
As host . The Chinese government and all social circles have attached high importance to The Games preparations began as early as in 1989 .
So it took 4 to 5 years to get ready .
Sure , in 1989 , Beijing agreed to undertake the event and in 1990 to State Council approved the establishment of the Organizing Committe .
What did you do all these years .
To be sure of the success of the sponsorship . The Chinese government allocated special funds for preparations .
Stadiums and gyms have all been renovated .
Facilities for the information center have been readjusted to meet needs .
Besides 5,000 volunteers have offered their services for the games .
China has won most medals during the Games so far are they professionals .
None of the Chinese athletes are professional .
They come from factories rural areas individual businesses and welfare institutes throughout China .
You led a delegation to observe FESPIC in beijing as president . How about your preparations for the 96 Paralympic .
Just 12 days after the Atlanta Olympics 4,000 elite athletes will come to Atlanta to compete .
We are just getting prepared .
When will be the 96 Paralympics hold .
August 16 to 27-1,99 .
How about the fundraising .
The budget for the Games was estimated at U S. $100 million . The organizing committee would work hard at the fundraising .
Also 15,000 volunteers had offered their services to help the athletes .
What are the themes and the mascot .
The theme for the Games is the triumph of the human spirit and Blaze , a Phoenix is the official mascot .
Are you confident that you will host a successful event .
I believe that the 96 Paralympics will be the most dynamic and spectacular of its kin .
Nice to meet you Mr. Brown .
Nice to meet you Mr. Yuang .
You must be tired after such a long journey .
Oh , just a bi .
Our players haven't got used to long trips .
Mr. Brown , let's discuss the Programme of a visit .
You're going to play 2 matches in Beijing , the first with our national team on Saturday evening . And the second , with the Beijing team on Sunday afternoon .
Is it possible to shift the second match to Tuesday evening .
Our players need at least 2 days' rest between matche .
I think it is impossible to have 2 days' rest tomorrow morning is for training in the practice hall of the Capital Gymnasium .
The bus leaves the hotel at 8:30 AM .
The program include 3 training sessions will that be enough .
The sports meeting will be held next month , can I participate in the 400 meter race .
Yes , you still have a month to train .
This is my first time running the 400 meter , could you tell me the competition regulation .
In the heats . You should try hard to perform well to be qualified for the semi-final .
Then what will I do if I am qualifie .
Those who are qualified will compete in 2 groups and the first 4 of each group will enter for the finals .
I just wonder whether the semi and final competitions will be held on the same day .
Probably so you have to train hard to be accustomed to the competing arrangements .
So I'll try to get the 4th . During the semi to save some energy and get ready for the final .
Sure , you are right .
Okay . I will try hard to perform well .
I hope you do wel .
It is said that someone has taken drugs to improve his performance at this Olympic .
Exactly .
I think he has not only lost his own face but also his nation' .
And it is very harmful to his own health .
What kinds of harm may it caus .
It may increase the risk of disease distorting normal physical growth and development , cancer and mental illness , etc .
How terribl .
If drugs win medals , the competition loses its meaning .
I agre .
Competition should be between athlete .
How will the matches be played .
Since there are 6 matches be played . So the single round robin system will be adopted .
So all the teams will compete in one group and the placings will be determined . According to the total points earned .
Yes , 2 points will be awarded for a win . One point for a tie and zero for a loss .
In that case , we must try har .
Of course every team will try to perform well .
Do you have any programs available .
Yes . Here it is .
Thank you very much .
Good luck to your team .
How many years have you been a coach .
About 5 year .
And you .
3 years .
What do you think of being a coach .
It's good to be a coac .
But sometimes I feel very tired .
So do I .
You know a good coach needs experience , knowledge and techniques that an athlete needs .
What's more , he should be able to get on well with other people , including his athletes the officials of the clubs and other coache .
You quite right on this point .
But when I see the athletes practicing very hard , I am touched and know that I must devote myself to coaching .
I understand you .
You're a very good coach I am sure .
Thank you .
Let's learn from each other .
Do you like your coach .
Of course .
He has a good sense of humo .
How old is he .
Is he tall .
He is 32 . He's quite tal .
I heard that he won a lot of prices when he was an athlete .
Really .
He must have been an excellent athlete .
And he's a good coach no .
Is he strict with you athletes .
While training us he is serious .
But when it's time for us to have a rest , we usually talk and laugh .
Well , though I haven't seen him I can imagine what kind of person he is .
Look , the one in white is our coach .
Wow , how smart he i .
Congratulations , Mr. Yang in accordance with the general regulations of the Games all medalists are requested to undergo a dope test after the final .
Oh I see .
We'd like to have a sample of your urin .
Would you please take this small cup with you and bring the sample , as soon as possible .
Okay .
Here it IS : May I know when I will be informed of the result .
It has to be delivered to the anti-doping center to be analyzed . We'll inform you of the result later .
Will it take long to have the test don .
It depends .
But , I suggest you attend the victory ceremony FIRST and thank you for your co-operatio .
Thank yo .
Welcome to shanghai , you must have had a long and tiresome flight from Sydney , but I'm sorry to tell you that you have to have a steroid test for your players before having their ID cards issued .
Oh , we are all very tired after such a long fligh .
Is it possible for us to have the tests tomorrow .
They badly want to sleep .
I'm afraid not .
With no ID cards issued the players can't get access to the gymnasium for training .
And women players have to have a steroid test upon arrival at the host country .
Oh I see .
But some players hold the certificates issued by the International Volleyball Federation do they also need to have the test .
In their case . No .
But they should go through the other formalities first .
But I assure you that doctors shall try to finish the tests as soon as possibl .
Would you please hand out the forms to the players .
Okay .
Now girls . The doctors are waiting to do the tests fill in the forms before a test .
Thank you very muc .
That's okay .
Athletes do exercises a lot .
Do most athletes have a healthy diet .
I'm afraid not .
Like most other people in China they eat too much animal fat and too much sal .
Most of them don't have a balanced diet . I think .
That's terribl .
You know , a balanced diet gives an athlete , the right amount of calories .
That's quite right .
Which do you think is the most important part of an athlete's diet .
Carbohydrates , which give energy are the most important part of an athlete's diet .
Where can carbohydrates be found then .
Well , they can be found in starchy foods like sweets and Cakes they can also be found in healthy foods like brown rice and past .
You know well about diet and nutrition How I hope our athletes have some facts about it .
So do I .
Don't you eat vegetables .
Have you ever paid attention to what you eat and drink .
No , never .
Generally , I eat my favorite foods .
What are your favorite foods .
Meat and fish .
Don't you eat vegetable .
I don't prefer vegetables but I like fruit .
I think you'd better eat some vegetables , you know , fiber can be found in fruit , vegetables , nuts and beans .
And fiber is very important , it helps the digestive system .
I didn't know so much . Thank you . Maybe I shall change my dietary habit .
Where are you going .
Take a walk . I have just watched a game it was really interesting .
What are you doin .
We are taking a walk too .
Oh , let me give you a test : What is the most distinct symbol of the Olympic Games .
That is a piece of cake . The 5 rings .
What colors are they .
How are they arranged .
Red , green , yellow , blue and black . Right .
As the arrangement .
I think the black color is in the middle and both sides are .
If our answer is right we should be rewarded .
I remember that the color of the 3 upper rings is blue black and Red and the yellow and green ones are under them .
Annie . Let me ask you a question .
What do the 5 rings represent .
What do they indicate .
Jeff , I don't want to teach fish how to swim before you the Olympic expert .
However , your question won't beat me .
The blue color represents Europe the black represents Africa the red represents America yellow represents Asian and the green represents Australia .
The 5 rings represent the close unity and friendly meeting at the Olympics between athletes from 5 continents .
Annie said it very wel .
Therefore there are 5 rings in both the Olympic flag and the Olympic emblem , which were carefully designed by Mr. Baron de Coubertin .
Mr. Baron de Coubertin was really grea .
Annie . I said it right just now What is the reward .
Well , let me give you an ice cream to relieve your internal heat .
I have seen the sign of faster , higher , stronger in many places on the campus .
That is the slogan of the olympics . It is also called the motto .
This is also one of the Olympic tenets .
Was it proposed by Mr. Baron de Coubertin too .
No , it was put forward in 1895 by his friend Henri Martin Didon .
He carved this sentence on the gate of his school .
In fact , it was also related to Mr. Baron de Coubertin later he suggested and in 1913 . The Olympic committee approved officially to use it as the Olympic slogan and the symbol , too .
The Olympics has another aphorism . The most important thing is to participate .
Tell me something about it .
That was in the marathon race of the 4th Olympic games , an Italian candy businessman called Peter Lee participated in it He was the first to complete the 42 kilometers and dashed into the gymnasium .
At that time , he was not conscious and he ran in the wrong direction . Several times he fell down and several times he stood up and continued Running he fell down again at a place only 15 meters from the Finish he could not get up this time . A journalist and a referee came to him and carried him to the finish limply .
Of course he did not get the Medal He was assisted by someone else .
It is so moving .
He did have a strong will .
Right . The next day at the awards ceremony , the Queen of England rewarded him with a trophy , the same as that of the champion's for his enterprising spirit .
Then a British bishop said : The most important thing for the Olympic Games is to participate , not to wi .
Therefore , the most important thing for the Olympic Games is to participate becomes the proverb of the Olympic Games .
That was a glorious defeat .
The Sydney Olympics is a watershed since its beginning . Anti-doping has risen from its traditional battle to the battle of biologic engineering .
I was told that the Olympic committee has warned the athletes that it was better for them to stay at home if they were unable to compete with their own abilities in the Olympic Games .
In the Oath of the athletes anti-doping is mentioned officially However some of the athletes still used i .
When did people start to use doping .
In 600 BC , the Roman Gladiators used stimulants in their fighting .
In the 10th Olympic Games . 1,932 the doping and gender tests on the athletes were employed for the First time However the official check-up was from the Rome Olympic Games in 1960 .
There were only a few kinds of doping at the very beginning . Now there are over 100 of them . Excluding the related compounds .
It caused great damage to the Athletes I have read in the newspapers that some of the athletes died during the Games because of taking doping .
They abused the gold medal and made the competition unfair .
Therefore , someone compares those stimulants as a cancer an underworld and the hack of the sports communit .
It can't be more visualize .
If we let doping indulge in willful persecution the future athletes would be like Dai Zong who was able to walk 500km a day , or they would be as strong as Arnold Schwarzenegger or as endurable as a camel , in the desert .
You are good at joking .
I hope that it is an unwarranted anxiety .
We hope that the Olympic Games will be increasingly pure and return to the spirit of faster , higher and stronger .
How can athletes get to the training and competition sites .

Where is the bus stop .
It's just outside the village near Gates number 1 and 2 .
Where can I get the timetable for shuttle buses .

Hi .
Hi .
Long-time no-see .
Where have you bee .
I went to Atlanta for the competition .
Oh really .
Can I ask you something about the Olympic Games .
Of course .
What's the Olympic creed .
The creed reads as follows : The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not to win , but to take part . Just as the most important thing in life is not the triumph , but the struggle .
The essential thing is not to have conquered , but to have fought well .
What's the Olympic Oath .
At the opening ceremony . An athlete from the host nation recites the following Oath , in the name of all competitors , I promise that we will take part in the Olympic Games representing and abiding by the rules which govern them in the true spirit of sportsmanship , for the glory of sport and honor of our teams .
One of the officials takes a similar oath on behalf of all judges and officials .
What's the Olympic flame .
The Olympic flame represents the continuity between the ancient and modem games .
During the early Olympics a sacred flame was burned at the altar of Zeus .
A modern version of the flame started from the Berlin Games in 193 .
And the tradition has been observed ever since .
A torch is used to kindle the flame .
It's first lit by the sun's rays at Olympia Greece and then carried to the site of the Games by relays of runners .
What's the origin of the Olympics .
The Olympic Games originated from ancient Greece .
They were a part of a religious festival in honor of the god Zeus .
The Olympic Games reached their peak by the 4 hundred's BC and then began to decline .
High Olympic ideals were forsaken .
Athletes were hired and some foreign athletes were even nationalized as Greeks to join the Games .
In 393 AD Emperor Theodosius I who was a Christian banned the Games as pagan shows .
What are the aims of the Olympics .
The aims are firstly to develop and promote peace understanding and friendship between countries .
Secondly , to bring together the best athletes in the world every 4 years .
How long did the Atlanta Olympics last .

From July 19 to August 4 .

Thank yo .
I'd like to attribute my victory to my excellent coach and his scientific training method and my efforts .
How did your training go before you came to this championship .

Of course I watch the NBA on TV .
Hi . John , do you practice Taijiquan .
A Little every morning I practice it .
Great . I'm now learning to do Qigong or breathing exercises .
It's fascinatin .
Well , I feel that in doing either . We have to be very attentive .
The exercises demand great concentration of min .
Exactly .
Perhaps that's the reason why it helps promote our health .
Besides the exercises have strict rules concerning postures and body positions It's so hard to learn them by hear .
Each form needs one posture and position and it changes on every form .
Can you practice the whole set no .
Well , I can only do the simplified version of taijiquan at the Moment . I hope some day soon I can do the original .
Chen , would you mind answering some questions about Taijiquan .
Not at all .
Please feel free to ask me anything concerning Taijiquan .
How do you feel after doing it for so long .
I'm now in better health .
Can I get a feel for the discipline , if I try a few very rudimentary movements .
Sure .
There are 100 or so different postures with wonderful names like White Crane spreads its wings needle at sea bottom wave hands like a cloud which give an idea of what you are expected to do , but you don't have to learn them all .
What should I learn first .
The first series involves several basic steps .
Now start out standing erect with both hands at your sides .
Relax yourself .
Your heels should be lightly touching as you sink slightly at the knee and then separate your feet to shoulder width by gently moving One Foot Straight Up gradually Your Feet should now be shoulder width apart .
Like thi .
Yes .
Just follow me .
Repeat the movement turning this time to the left .
I've just seen a marvelous kung fu movie .
I was deeply impressed by the Chinese martial arts in it .
Yes . Chinese kung fu is well known throughout the world .
Chen every time I visit People's Park I find some old people doing relaxed smooth and graceful form of exercises .
That's Taijiqua .
It is suitable for people of all ages and physical conditions .
You can't help but notice its enormous following . When you go out for a walk , especially during the early morning .
Then this Chinese discipline is used as a physical fitness program It doesn't seem like a form of boxin .
The discipline is actually a soft or internal form of Chinese boxing or kung f .
Is there any relationship between Taijiquan and qigong .
Yes .
Qigong is the generic range of breathing exercises , they all focus on quiet concentration .
Coordination is also important .
Is it difficult to learn to perform Taijiquan .
It is not so complex as it was .
As more and more people are taking up Taijiquan as a form of exercise the State physical culture and sports commission has had taijiquan simplified to meet the demands of ordinary peopl .
What kind of Qigong do you practice .
Well I practice Xiang gong .
What is Xiang Gon .
Xiang gong literally means fragrant qigong it was made public in 1988 by an expert practioner in Luoyang Henan province .
Tian Ruisheng has popularized it throughout the country .
Then why is it called Xiang gong then .
It is so named because it's said good practice of it can produce a fragrant smell from the body of the person .
Have you smelled it yet .
Not yet .
But it doesn't matter .
I think what matters is that every day I can set aside a certain period of concentrating and thinking about nothing else at all .
That I think is very helpful .
Is that Qigong classified .
Yes . Like other Qigong exercises Xiang gong is divided into 3 stages . That is a primary stage an intermediate stage and a senior state .
Is it hard to get into it .
No . Unlike other Qigong exercises . It's very easy to Start you can start practice anywhere and anytim .
Kenneth what will be the venue for sailing at Athens 2004 .
I don't know .
At the 27th Olympics , the Rushcutters Bay of Sydney was selected as the venue for the sailing competition .
Do you think sailing interesting .
To me it is more interesting and exciting than any other sports .
I was engaged in sailing in my teens and I once represented my city in some competition .
Really .
I've never heard you mention that experience .
I think you were a very good sailor and used to score high .
If I had been good . I wouldn't have scored high .
The scoring system for sailing is quite different from other sports .
In general , scores are awarded as points based upon the boats finishing position in each race .
The winner of each race scores one point second place gets 2 points , 3rd place , 3 points , etc .
Those that did not finish scored points , equal to one more than the number of boats that had gone through the event .
You mean the fewer points you get the better racer you are .
Yes .
How many classes of boats were included in the Olympic .
On most occasions . There are 9 .
The accurate number of classes at Sydney is 1 .
How are the boats categorize .
Different classes of boats are of different length width weight and even their sails are of different areas .
Take length for example 470 class is 4.7m Finn class is 4.5m Tornado class is 6-0 9 meters Laser class is 4.23m Star class is 6.92m Soling class is 8.15m Europe class is 3.35m Mistral is 3.72m and 40-niner class is 4.99 .
You are so great to tell those numbers at a stretch .
Besides , I wonder what are the basic skills required of the sailing competitors .
Sailing requires endurance and strengt .
And a sailor must also excel in boat handling and competing tactics he should be able to figure out at which angle to sail and on which tack in order to sail the shortest distance in the strongest wind .
Of course he must obey the race rules and try to avoid committing such fouls as hitting the yachting mark .
What should the racer Do If He has hit a yachting mar .
He'll have to circle the mark for 360° more before he can set himself free .
What if he commits a foul of false star .
He'll have to come back behind the starting line , to begin his sail again .
It'll be a loss to the competito .
I'd really want to pick sailing up as a hobb .
Can you give me some instructions .
I'd love to .
I am not familiar with water polo .
Could you please tell me something about it in details .
Of COURSE Water Polo is played between 2 teams on each team , there are 11 players , of whom 4 are substitutes .
Since water polo is a team game . How do referees identify the players .
All players wear numbered caps one team wears white caps the other blue .
The goalkeeper's cap is red .
How long does a game last .
Play lasts for 4 periods of 5 minutes each .
There is a 2 minute interval between 2 periods for changing ends .
What will happen if there is a tie .
In case of a tie . There is a 5-minute break followed by 2 periods of 3 minutes' play with one minute interval betwee .
This pattern continues until a definite result is reached .
John , you look so strong .
How I envy you .
I think you've heard the Saying : a sound mind dwells in a sound body .
I have always tried my best to keep fit for both my study and work .
Right you are .
Can you give me some tips as to how to keep fit .
In my mind , the best way to keep fit is to go in for sports .
What kind of sports do you participate in .
I go swimming once a week .
I do this even in cold winter .
I used to swim in high school , but I don't have time anymore .
That's too bad .
Exercise is really important for your healt .
I know .
I'm getting a little fat .
I am short of breath when going upstairs .
That's a bad sign .
I think you need more exercise .
Well I'm going swimming tonigh .
Do you want to go with me .
Oka .
I really need to get in shape again .
Good morning , Bob .
Where are you bound .
Oh , it's you Tom .
I'm off for a dip in the bay .
Won't you come along .
I only wish I could .
I should like nothing better .
But I have an engagement at 9 this morning and must be on hand sharp on time .
I'm sorry , you cannot come .
You swim , don't you .
I'm learning . But I am not an expert in the water yet .
Do you go in often .
I used to take a cold plunge every morning but recently I have not been up to it .
Still , I am very fond of an early morning bath .
It sets up the circulation for the day .
Sorry , I can't stop more than a MOMENT bye .
Bye .
Was that the butterfly you were doing .
No , I was using the breaststroke .
They look very similar .
I suppose they d .
I like the breaststroke better than the butterfly because it uses less energy .
Could you teach me the breaststroke .
Sure , it's not very difficult to learn .
I hope we'll be able to swim somewhere .
How about to the swimming pool at the central gymnasiu .
That's boring .
I went there last Saturday .
I think you should go to a swimmers' poo .
Oh , we are planning to go to the seaside next weekend . Why not join u .
Will we be able to swim when we get ther .
Yes , I think so .
But you have no diving tower or springboard or any lane ther .
Now you .
How about the tide there .
The tide will be out . It'll be safe anywher .
For you won't be able to dive off the Rocks just when the tide is in . You'll be able to dive .
That's all right . I like diving but I prefer swimming .
When is high tid .
Low tide was at about 9 o'clock in the mornin .
So high tide will be at about 4 , the next afternoon .
Can you swim .
Yes I can swim a little .
Are you fond of it .
Yes . I like it very much .
You are a fine swimmer I presum .
No , I'm a very poor swimmer I can swim in a swim pool but I don't think I can do so in the sea .
If you can swim in the swim pool , you can then swim in the sea more easil .
Why .
Because the sea water is more buoyant than fresh water as it contains salt you know .
Yes but I dare not to tr .
It is rather hot shall we take a cold bathe in the sea .
All right . I will go to bathe with you .
Do you want to race .
Oh , I know you're a lot faster than me , John .
What are you so afraid of .
I don't know how to swim . Joh .
I'm sorry .
I didn't realize tha .
I thought everyone knew how to swim .
No one ever taught me so I never learne .
Old Huang Linlin is excellen .
This time he's sure to get a chance to meda .
I hope so .
Since he finished 4th in the Atlanta Olympics only 0-7 second slower than the 3rd . Linlin has trained even harder .
He has a great mind to get a meda .
Old Huang during the '70s . You were the Most Outstanding Swimmer in Chin .
Now your son has inherited your fame and has made himself the brightest star in swimming .
He has lived up to the country's and my expectations .
He wins the medal for his country and his people .
Old Huang has begun to train Huang Lin to swim since his childhood .
Old Huang can be called Linlin's first teacher in swimmin .
When Linlin was only 5 years old I found he was talented in swimming .
Actually he has very good water feelings .
I worked out a plan for him and led him to understand not only the sense of touch in water , but also the sense of resistance of body and the sense of body position in the process of progression though water .
He's quite sensitive .
Old Huang was very strict with Linli .
Sometimes , there was no eating or sleeping until Linlin had got the hang of technique .
Without old Huang Linlin couldn't have been an early bloome .
Without the rigorous training his own constant effort and above all , his coaches in the national swimming team Linlin couldn't have made such a big progress and got a chance to medal .
Do you swim very often .
Yes I swim 3 times a week .
Let's go swimming .
All right , I'll get my swimming suit .
Was that the butterfly you were doin .
No , I was using the breaststroke .
They look very simila .
I suppose they do .
I like the breaststroke better than the butterfly because it uses less energy .
Could you teach me the breaststroke .
Sure , it's not very difficult to lear .
What's the spearhead principle in swimming competitions .
In each event the competitor with the fastest entry time is assigned the center lane or right of the center .
The other swimmers are placed alternately left and right of him in descending order of speed , so that the slowest swimmers are in the 2 outside lanes .
If the entry times are a true indication of form the swimmers will fan out into a spearhead formation during the rac .
What's the order of storks in medley events .
In individual events competitors swim an equal distance of 4 Strokes the sequence is butterfly backstroke breaststroke and freestyle .
And the order in medley relays .
In medley relays each swimmer swims one stroke for the set distance . The order is backstroke breaststroke butterfly and freestyle .
Chinese women swimmers won 8 gold medals and broke one world record last night .
Did they really .
What match did they compete in this time .
The short course swimming World Cup .
It is the second leg of a series of World Cup tournaments around the worl .
Where did the competition take place .
At Yingdong swimming pool in Beijing .
Qian Hong set a new Olympic record on her way to winning the women's 100-meter butterfly .
What time did she clock .
She clocked 58.62 seconds .
The time was also her personal bes .
It is , said Qian Hong is getting old for swimmin .
Qian Hong Is 21 , her coach Feng Xiaodong said 21 , is an age not young for a swimmer coupled with poor health , she has paid a high price to win in Barcelona .
Qian Hong is the first Chinese swimmer to get into the world's top 10 .
She has not dropped out of the top 10 in the last 5 years .
Would you care to go swimming .
Swimming .
Oh NO I'm scared of WATER . I'm sorry .
Well , we could do something else .
That's kind of yo .
Hey , Jane . Where are you going this weekend .
Hi , Bob . I'm going to the beach with some friends .

Which Beach , are you going to .
We were thinking about driving to the north to Grover's Beach .
I like to watch the sea birds there .

Do you have space for me in one of the cars .
Sure , we'll fit you into a car .
Great .
Where should we meet .
Meet me on Friday in front of my house .
Okay , I'll see you then . Bye .
What kind of sports do you participate in .

I think you need more exercise .
Well I'm going swimming tonigh .
Do you want to go with me .
Okay .
I really need to get in shape again .
Congratulations on your winning the 200-meter freestyle .
Thank you very much . I'm very happy , especially because I didn't expect to achieve such a good result .
As a dark horse . What's your idea during your contest .
In the pool . I tried to feel as if I was just fighting against myself as if didn't have any opponents .
You set a milestone for Chinese swimmers in the middle distance swimming to be ranked the world top level .
Thank you .
I'd like to attribute my victory to my excellent coach and his scientific training method and my efforts .
How did your training go before you came to this championship .
I believe in my potential after a year with the national team . And I had altogether swum a total distance of 3200 kilometers this yea .
So the record was not a surprise because you knew that , you had the ability to win .

No one ever taught me so I never learned .
It's hot today . Shall we go for a dip at the beac .
That's a good idea .
Let's bring our trunks and towels .
Would you like to swim in the swimming pool or at the beach .
I'd prefer the pool .
Okay .
Let's pay the entrance fee and change our clothes in the dressing room .
What style do you use .
Well , I use the breaststroke for long distance crawl or free style for a short distance and back stroke just for fun .
When watching swimming races . I find the fastest is most likely to be the one who is assigned the number 4 or number 5 lane .
I suppose you're watching semifinals or finals .
Actually such arrangement follows one principle called spearhead .
What is it .
As in the Olympic final . According to the results of preliminary races the fastest is assigned to the 4th lane the second fastest to the 5th lane the 3rd to the 3rd lane the 4th to the 6 lane et .
If the entry times are a true indication of their abilities . The racers will fan out into the shape of a spearhead during the rac .
It's a spectacle .
But sometimes dark horses do break the shape .
What swimming events are included in the Olympic .
32 at sydney . They consist of freestyle backstroke breaststroke butterfly individual medley and relay .
What do you mean by individual medley .
It's a race in which competitors swim equal distances in each of the 4 basic strokes .
And the 4 strokes should be in this order first butterfly secondly backstroke then breaststroke and finally freestyle .
Are there any rules that stipulate , the order of relay .
Yes .
The order of Relay is backstroke breaststroke butterfly and freestyl .
Which do you think is the fastest .
The front crawl I Suppose That's the stroke required of freestyle .
In freestyle each arm is alternately brought over the top and then plunges into the water in front of The Swimmer at the same time the legs perform a rapid kicking actio .
What's the length of a lane .
50 meter .
In races longer than that racers have to turn when they have reached the end of it .
How does the judge know whether or not the racers have actually reached the end .
Both ends of the lane are equipped with an electronic Touch Pad it can automatically record and display the touch , which saves the judge . A lot of trouble .
Hi tech is incredible How do the racers turn .
Most swimmers take the Tumble Turn for it is the fastest tur .
But in the races of butterfly and breaststroke they can't turn until both hands have simultaneously touched the wall of the pool , so they take a spin turn .
Next time I watch the swimming race , I'll pay some attention to such details .
Look , Ian Thorpe stands up and waves to the audience .
He looks very confiden .
He Should Be : he is the Olympic and world record holder in the 400 meters freestyle .
At Sydney 2000 , he covered 400 meters in 340 59 .
And he is the winner in the heats . So he is assigned the 4th lane .
What did the starter say .
Start your marks .
The competitors grasp the front edge of the platform . It's called a grab start .
There goes the gunshot .
The swimmer in the second lane jumps the sho .
Maybe he is too nervou .
Tom , in the 5th line is leading .
Come on , Ian .
Great .
Ian catches up and overtakes Tom .
Ian is about to turn .
Look at the screen the underwater camera aims at his turning .
That's a flip turn , the fastest turn .
Tom catches Up . Now he is even with Ia .
Yes . He is neck to neck with Ian .
Only 10 meters now .
Come on . Tom .
They almost touch the wall simultaneously .
Tom clocks 48 point zero one-0 0-1 faster than Ian .
Great .
You are great Tom you beat the record holder .
I hope we'll be able to swim somewhere .
How about going to the swimming pool at the Beijing gymnasium .
That's boring .
I went there last Saturday .
I think you should go to a swimmers' pool .
Oh , we are planning to the seaside next weekend . Why not join us .
Shall we be able to swim when we get ther .
Yes , I think so .
But you have no diving tower or springboard or any lane ther .
Now you .
How about the tide there .
The tide will be out . It'll be safe anywher .
For you won't be able to dive off the rock .
Just when the tide is in . You'll be able to dive .
That's all right . I like diving but I prefer swimming .
When is high tid .
Low tide was at about 9 o'clock in the morning so high tide will be at about 4 , the next afternoon .
Does your girlfriend like swimming .
Yes , she does .
She is good at backstroke and freestyle .
Then you can help her with breaststroke and sidestrok .
But she wants to learn butterfly stroke .
Really .
Then just ask her to follow m .
I heard you are now practicing underwater swimming , aren't yo .
Yes .
But I still have some difficulties in breathing .
Say kid keep on practicing you're sure to be a first class swimmer .
To tell you the truth . I have never thought of being a swimmer I swim just for fun .
So you can swim the breaststroke a little .
Yes , but I can only swim about the Length after that I swim like a brick DOWN then I need a lifeguard to rescue me from drowning .
You just need more practice and a little extra instruction .
Some people say that I swim like a fish because I come here , maybe 3 times a week to practice and work out . I only swim in the summer . It's too cold in the winter .
Yes . Swimming is a good workout it exercises every muscle in my BODY , it keeps me fit and my body in shape and I have fun at the same time .
You're right about tha .
It has got to be one of the best all around exercises in the WORLD working out this way is fun , too .
Without a doubt .
Let's do some warm-up exercises before beginning swimming .
You don't want to pull a muscle , while you're in the pool . Do you .
Of course , you foo .
I pulled a muscle once and it was very painfu .
You'll get accustomed to i .
You should always start by exercising by the side of the pool to warm up your muscles .
So let's begin .
12341234 .
Now we're ready to start .
Did you remember to bring a kickboard with you .
I did I bought the whole outfit this morning A kickboard a pair of goggles a swimsuit and a swimming cap all matching .
I've also brought along the inflatable ring that I originally learnt to swim with as well as a pair of new trunks for you .
Thanks . It sounds that you're well prepared , let's get into the shallow end and start the lessons .
I'd prefer to jump in that way you don't notice the cold water as much .
So you know how to do the breaststroke .
Yes , but I can only swim well enough to keep my head above the water and keep myself form drowning .
I think it is the easiest stroke to do .
Maybe .
But I prefer this one because it's the most friendly .
What do you mean by the most friendly .
Well , you can keep your head above the water . Most of the time . So you can swim lengths and talk to your friends . At the same time .
.
I see what you mea .
If I do the backstroke . I usually find myself bumping into other people in the pool . Because I can't see where I'm going . And every time I swim the butterfly stroke I splash water about so much it disturbs everyon .
Do you ever swim free style .
I often see people swimming that .
Yes I DO it's my favorite .
Mainly because it's the quickest , but also because I know the key to doing it well .
I've tried to do it but unsuccessfully . I couldn't breathe and swim at the same time .
I kept swallowing too much water .
That's because you don't know the key to doing it well , controlling your breathing .
You'll need to master that first otherwise your swimming will always be like the doggy paddle you'll splash water around a lot with very little result .
So it's because I can't control my breathing .
I have enough things to think about just trying to swim .
Well , I think that's what we're going to start today's lesson with .
Then perhaps in a few weeks I'll teach you how to dive .
Do you mean how to dive into the water from a diving board .
No , how to dive under the water .
It adds something new to your Swimming it makes it more interestin .
But you'll have to learn to hold your breath firs .
I can't wait for tha .
Swimming under the water must be a lot of fu .
You're right about that .
I can swim under the water for about 50 meters holding my breath . Then I come up gasping for air but it's great breath .
But it's a great feeling to be able to do it .
Well , let's start before the pool gets too crowde .
Okay .
Hi , Tom . Do you like swimming .
Yes .
What about you bil .
I do too .
Do you usually swim in a river or a lake .
I often swim in a river .
The water . There is very clean and fresh .
You're right what styles . Do you us .
I like the butterfly strok .
And you .
I prefer the breaststroke though I can also do the sidestroke .
I still remember how I learned to swim at the very beginnin .
It was so TERRIBLE I choked several times on wate .
Can you tread water .
No , I am sorry , I can't .
Well , don't be so upse .
You will if you practice a lot .
Actually I practiced for a long time before I could .
Thank you for your encouragement .
What do you often do after school in the summer .
We often go swimmin .
Do you swim in a swimming pool .
No : There is no swimming pool in Our Town we go swimming in the river .
Who taught you to swim .
No one I learned it by myself .
Really .
How clever you are .
Can you swim .
Ye .
Let's go swimming this afternoon . Okay .
Okay .
Rosa . I find it hard to distinguish between rowing canoeing and kayaking .
Can you clarify them for me .
In fact , you can tell rowing very easily from the other 2 .
In rowing the rower sits against the direction of the boat that is with his back toward the finishing line while the canoeist or the kayaker faces the finishing line .
How can I tell a canoe from a kaya .
You see Rosa canoes are open boats competitors kneel in the boats and move them through the water using single bladed paddles .
Kayaks are closed boats and the paddles have blades at both ends . Competitors use their feet to control a rudder that steers the boa .
What events does canoeing consist of at the Olympics .
The specific events vary , but basically C 1 C-2 K-1 K 2 K 4 and white water slalom racing are held for Men but for women only kayaking events are available .
What does C 1 or K-1 stands for .
C is the initial letter of canoes so C 1 refers to one man canoeing .
I've got it .
K-1 means one man kayaking doesn't i .
You are right .
What's the distance , they'll have to cove .
For some events , 500 meters and for some others 1,000 meters .
How about whitewater slam canoeing .
A slalom course should be 3,000 meters at least .
Where does the Whitewater slam race takes place .
On a whitewater course of COURSE competitors are required to pass 20 to 30 gates .
Their goal is to finish the journey as fast and clean as possible .
What's the gate fo .
Gates are placed on the course to challenge the racer's whitewater skill .
A gate is composed of 2 color striped poles that are suspended from an aerial wire that spans the race waterway .
The poles of a gate are approximately one meter apart .
Racers are to avoid hitting the pole .
It must be very thrillin .
Kate did you watch some of the rowing events yesterda .
No , Bill .
I was too busy yesterday .
Besides I knew little about it .
I watched the final of men's quadruple sculls it was wonderful .
Which team won the gold meda .
The Italian team did .
They cooperated very well .
Their team work was the key to their success .
I guess they must be very strong .
They ar .
Simone Raineri impressed me mos .
He demonstrated unusual strength and skills .
His stroke is smooth leg drive powerful recovery fas .
How fast did they scul .
I think more than 45 strokes a minute .
Can the rate of striking be that high .
Yes .
I guess it might have reached 47 or 48 strokes in the sprin .
Sprint .
That's the last 500 meters of the race .
It is the point that everyone will try their bes .
Whoever has the guts to go even faster wins .
Did the scull have a Cox .
No it's coxless .
You know so much about rowing . It seems as if you are a rowing fan .
But I've never rowed a boat .
What are the different heights of the high board platform .
The high board are 3 meters . 5 meters , 7.5 meters and 10 meters high .
How high are the springboards .
The springboards are 1-meter and 3 meters high .
What is the springboard made out of .
The springboard is made out of an aluminum extrusion .
The springboard has a fulcrum which can be adjusted by the divers .
How deep is the diving pool .
The diving pool should be 6 meters dee .
What about the surface of the water is it smoot .
No , there is mechanical surface agitation of the water .
This aids the diver's entry .
What are the individual elements of a dive .
A dive consists of the starting position the run the hurdle , the take off the execution and the entry .
It's Chen Wei's turn .
Check what he choose .
A forward 4.5 somersaults with the degree of difficulty , 3.5 .
This is the death dive .
A former Soviet diver died attempting it in an international competition .
He slammed his head into the tower on the second somersault fracturing his skull .
How terribl .
Chen Wei poises himself at the top of the platfor .
His leg muscle tense and he rises on his toe .
He pushes himself away from the tower .
He begins to spi .
Once , twice , 3 times 4 times plus one more hal .
He rips the surface of the pool .
Yeah .
Small splas .
Perfect .
Really terrific .
He averages a score of 8.9 from each judge .
And his total score is 691. .
Chen Wei has the gold medal in the bag .
Fu Mingxia has become China's youngest Olympic gold medalist here in Barcelon .

She will be 14 one week after the Barcelona Games .
When did she win her first world diving champion .
At the age of 12 .
This time she dived into gold with a victory margin of 50 points in a sport where titles often are decided by 10 points or less .
So Fu Mingxia has the best gift for her 14th birthday .
Douglas is stepping up the tower .
He's going to do his 7th dive , the forward 1 and a half-somersaults with a half-twist .
The degree of difficulty is 2.0 .
Great .
Small splas .
His score is 69.5 .
His total score is 472.3 .
Chen Wei is preparing for his 7th dive .
He's going to do the forward 3.5 somersaults tucked with the degree of difficulty , valued at 2.7 .
Chen Wei , looks very confiden .
Wonderful .

He's a close second now closely followed Douglas .
Fu Mingxia has become China's youngest Olympic gold medalist here in Barcelona .
How old is the little diving champio .
She will be 14 one week after the Barcelona Games .
When did she win her first world diving champion .
At the age of 12 .

So Fu Mingxia has the best ever gift for her 14th birthday .
She's really talented for diving .
GAO Min has won a second title at the Barcelona Olympic Game .
It's a piece of cake for her to win a title .
As far as I know , she has never lost in any major world tournaments , including the World Cup World Championships and the Olympics since her victory at the 1986 World Championships in Madrid .
But she was lagging behind in the 3rd place after preliminaries in the final . She stayed behind Russian Irina Lashko until the 7th dive .
Why was she lagging behind in the preliminaries .
GAO Min is famous for her hard training .
She said she had injuries to both shoulders and her waist . For a long time .
The injuries were the result of hard training and competition . And she said she had been receiving medical treatment , continually since coming to Barcelona .
I see .
It's not easy to be a sportswoma .
I heard that Gao Min wanted to retire right after 1,990 Beijing Asian Game .
That was TRUE but people encouraged her to keep on this time she may retir .
What's she going to do then .
She said she needed at least one year before deciding what she is going to do next .
Kaiming here is great news for you . China won another gold medal in diving today .
Who was it and for what even .
Tian Liang won the Gold Medal of men's platform .
How many medals has China won in diving alone .
10-5 golds and 5 silvers .
It's safe to say China is a dominant country in diving .
You see , I know very little about diving .
I am busy with my work all day and have no time to watch the live broadcas .
A freelance writer . You are so lucky .
Can you tell me how many diving events there are at the Olympics .
4 for men and women each springboard synchronized springboard platform synchronized platform .
Are synchronized events newly added to Sydney 2000 .
Yes .
Synchronized diving is unique because it features 2 divers as a team .
The 2 divers of a team perform either on the 3 meter springboard or 10 meter platform using the same or similar dives .
3-meter Springboard and 10 meter platform were the only 2 diving events represented at the past Olympic .
What's the depth of the diving pool .
6 meter .
How many dives does a racer have to take in an event .
In the springboard event men take 11 dives and women take 10 dives .
In the platform event men take 10 dives and women take 8 dive .
They consist of some required dives and some optional dive .
For example , the men's springboard consist of 5 required dives and 6 optional dives .
What are the required dives .
A forward dive a backward dive a reverse dive an inward dive and a forward dive with a half-twist .
These dives may be performed straight piked or with Tuck .
I've heard of the degree of Difficulty what's its range .
It ranges from 1.2 for a simple forward dive to 3.5 for a highly difficult forward 4.5 somersault div .
What positions can divers take during the execution of the dive .
The basic positions they can take are straight position free position Pike or tuc .
Fu Mingxia impressed me most with her wonderful and perfect entry .
How did she achieve it .
The key was her painstaking practice coupled with some skills .
She lands on the palms of the hands and opens the water with THEM also she performs a breaststroke motion with her arms under water so creating pockets of air on either side of her body .
This effect leaves only foam on the surface of the WATER There is no splash .
Tomorrow , I'll be FREE . I can watch the Olympics all day .
Are there diving events tomorro .
The diving competitions have come to an end .
GAO Min has won a second title at the Barcelona Olympic Game .

What's she going to do then .
She said she needed at least one year before deciding what she is going to do next .
And there is bad news for another Chinese diver Tan Liangde .
What has happened .
For the rest of his life , he could be known as the silver medal man .
He failed in his 3rd Olympic effort to win the gold medal in men's springboard here in Barcelona .
What positions may a diver take during the execution of the dive .
Dives may be executed in several basic positions straight position free position Pike or tuck .
How should a diver enter the wate .
A diver may enter the water feet first or head first with head first dives the body must be vertical with the feet together and the toes pointed the arms must be stretched above the head and in line with the body and the hands close together .
How does a diver achieve a perfectly clean entr .
The diver lands on the palms of the hands and opens the water with THEM Also the diver may perform a breaststroke motion with his arms under water so creating pockets of air on either side of his Body this effect leaves only foam on the surface of the WATER There is no splash .
This technique is called a rip entr .

The 100 meter race is going to be broadcasted live in a minute .
Oh really .
I'm up now .
You don't wash your fac .
No .
100 meter race is my favorit .
It makes me goofy .
This is really a terrific summer .
I can finish watching all the events before the university opens .
You watch the Olympics by day and sit by the computer by night .
You really enjoy your holiday .
That's life .
You don't go for your training .
It's an off day .
Where are Dad and Mum .
Gone to work .
Yes .
Earlier this morning .
What's wrong .
You look pale .
I failed in the preliminary for the 100 meter dash .
I was rather disappointed at my performance yesterday .
I am sorry to hear that .
I am very disappointed at not getting a chance to compete in the final .
What a pity .
But you still have your 200 meter race .
It is a bad beginning .
But I hope that I can perform well in the next event .
Don't worry , you'll do better next time , I'm sure .
Hi .
Hi .
What event . Are you in .
Decathlon .
May I ask you a few question .
Yes , please .
Could you tell me what's the difference between track and field .
Athletic events are divided into 2 broad categories track and field .
Each has its particular event .
Can you make it more specific .
Okay .
Events on the track , can be divided into several sections .
On the flat there are sprints middle distance races and long distance races .
There are also the 4 100m relay and the 4 400m relay .
In addition , races are run over hurdles and barriers from 110 meters , up to 3000 meters .
Extreme distance races include the marathon , over 42 kilometers and the men's 50 kilometers road walk .
What about the events in the field .
Events in the field can be divided into 2 Sections jumping and throwing .
Jumping events include the high jump , long jump triple jump and pole vault .
Throwing events comprise the javelin discus hammer and shot put .
I se .
The women's 100m race is to be broadcasted live right awa .
Really .
I won't miss it for anything It makes me goofy .
What a terrific summer I can finish watching all the Olympic events before returning back to school .
Hurry .
The sprinters are in their lanes now They are doing up some warming up exercises .
The race must be tense and close , I suppose .
We get Gail Devers women's 100m champion of the 26th Olympic games and the defending champion this time and .
Listen Gail is in the 3rd lane .
Who's that woman in the 5th lane .
Marion Jone .
I thought you knew all of them .
Not everyone .
Is she . An Australian .
No . She is an American .
What was the performance by Gail at Atlanta .
10.94 seconds .
I know nothing about Marion she looks calm .
But I guess she can't rival Gail .
You know , Gail is very good at acceleration after 20 meters .
However , you must be aware of the fact that few can be consecutive Champions at the Olympics .
What's the world record of the women's 100 meters .
10.49 second .
Griffith Joyner sets it in Indianapolis in 1988 .
I remember . She was a 1,988 Seoul gold medal winner wasn't sh .
That's right .
But he didn't break the world record she made although she set an Olympic record of 10.62 seconds .
Look .
The final is on the line .
The starter calls the runners stand behind their blocks .
They are to rise to the set position .
What's wrong with you .
Oh , nothin .
Just nervous .
You seem to be more nervous and excited than the sprinters .
It fire .
Great .
Gail takes the lea .
But Marion catches up overtakes Gale hits the line .
Marion ran a perfect race .
Terrific .
Oh 10.75 seconds .
Incredible Marion is something .
Hurry up the clerk of the course is calling the roll .
My Go .
Where's my number .
Well , it's in my jacket .
Wear it on your chest .
Don't be nervous . Mind your start and don't beat the gun again this time .
I will .
According to the workout . We are going to practice on 100m dash in this class . And we will begin with start techniques .
What kind of start . Are we going to practice .
Crouching start or elongated start .
The elongated one .
Shall we use block .
No . As a beginner you needn't start from blocks .
What's the program for men's 800m .
The heats will be at 9 Monday Morning the semi-finals will be at 16 Wednesday afternoon and the finals will be at 14 Sunday afternoon .
It's the last lap Tome and Jack are still running abreast .
They are coming off the home curve .
Look tome has sped up .
He's sprinting at his top speed .
Jack is speeding up too . I am sure he has won the match .
I don't think so they crossed the tape at the same tim .
The electric Photo timer will tell .
What's wrong .
You look pale .
I failed in the preliminary for the 100 meter dash .
I was rather disappointed at my performance yesterday .
I am sorry to hear that .
I am very disappointed at not getting a chance to compete in the final .
What a pity .
But you still have your 200 meter race .
It is a bad beginning .
But I hope that I can perform well at the next even .
Don't worry , you'll do better next time , I'm sure .
Hello , Mar .
Fancy meeting you again .
Hello , Jan .
Haven't seen you for a long time .
I suppose you are here for field events .
No . I'll take part in the 100 meter low hurdle .
That's in track events .
Oh my .
What a bad memory .
You won the dash race last year .
You still compete in long distance race .
No this time I'll try a maratho .
That's a great challenge .
I hear your boyfriend is also her .
Yes . He is just over there . The one in blu .
Oh so tall and so strong .
And he is intelligent too .
Intelligent .
What do you mean .
Well he can speak 5 languages .
Can h .
What languages can he spea .
He can speak French , Spanish , Italian , German and Japanese .
Oh so great .
Is he a high jumper .
No : He is a discus thrower .
Then mind that he throws you out sometime .
He dares not .
Now , is there anything new today .
Yes . The world women's 5,000 meters record is broken .
Who broke it .
I don't know her name .
But she is a new one and the time was much faster .
By how many seconds did she break the mark .
She clocked 14: 28- .
Oh I remember the listed world record is 1436 45 held by a Portuguese .
Yes , she's much faster than the Portuguese .
I'm sure if with exercises of a systematic and scientific training method she will win the next Olympics .
You're quite right .
As scheduled men's javelin is to take place this afternoo .
What do you think are the fundamental qualities of thrower .
First of all , good coordination is the most important skill required of throwers .
The results won't be good unless the postures and movements of the body are well-coordinated .
Therefore footwork is also a key factor to influence the result .
At the time of delivery the head should be erect and the back straight .
Besides the thrower should have good balance , especially during the rotation of the body .
He must deliver the missile and at the same time stay inside the throwing circle .
What's the most important technique for javelin throwing .
Correct and powerful arm action . I think .
What are the requirements for the throw itself .
The rules for javelin are more complex and specific than most people think , for example the shoes of the thrower are limited to a certain range of thickness .
As for the basic requirements . First the javelin , must be held at the grip and thrown over the shoulder or upper part of the arm . It may not be slung and hurled .
And in landing the tip of the metal head must strike the ground before any other part of the javelin .
Before releasing the javelin the competitor may not turn his or her back toward the throwing arc .
And throwers can't touch the arc , can they .
Of course not .
They can't touch the strip that marks the throwing Arc or its extension lines or the ground beyond .
If they do .
If they do the throw will be declared a foul .
That's the worst thing for athletes I suppose .
Who is most likely to win the first place this afternoon .
Zelezny from the Czech .
Let's wait and see .
But I really can't wait to see the competition .
Good morning , Bob , you're an early bird .
Good morning . John you're also early people often say that morning is the best time of a day for physical exercises .
Yes , I've been in the habit of getting up early and doing exercises in the morning .
Oh the Spring Track and Field meet will be held a month from now have you entered for any events .
Yes . Broad jump and disc throwing I'm good at them .
The school records of these 2 games were set up by me Last Year . I hope I can break them this time .
What about you . I know you're good at running .
Yes I like running I've signed up for 100 meter dash and 800 meter race .
I have planned to take part in the 5000 meter long-distance run . As I have good endurance , you know .
But there's a limit to the number of games . One can sign up for , so I have to give it up .
What a pity , but I'm sure you'll win honors for your class in the above games as well .
I'm not so sure myself .
My records of these games have never been very good .
What's more I haven't done enough practice for the .
But I think if we practice hard in the following few weeks we can expect to do better .
Thank you for your encouragement .
No matter what the results will be I'll do my best .
By the way . Aren't you on your class' tug of war team .
No , not really .
Why .
You see , I was asked to be the cheerleade .
Oh , it's also very importan .
Nobody can do better than you at this .
Thank yo .
I watched a high jump event last night . There are some parts . I don't understan .
What are they .
If 2 athletes both make the same height but failed in the next one who will be the winner .
It will depend on who had fewer misses on that height .
What if it is still the sam .
Look at the last one , if it's still the same . Keep going .
What if they are all the same .

Where have you been recently Mason .
I've been learning jud .
Is it difficult .
The judo itself is not difficult to Learn . But the terms for it are very hard .
You see judo originated from Japan so judo terms are for the most part , Japanese words .
Is your instructor a Japanese .
No he is a Chinese and he is a very good judoka .
If the Japanese ranking system were applied to him , I believe he would rank among the 7th or the 8th Dan .
Is he .
I hear judokas wear belts of different colors to show their technical rank .
Yes .
For instance , judokas of the highest rank , that is the 10th Dan wear a red belt .
Which is more important in judo strength or techniques .
Techniques .
The key to success is to employ a good technique to throw the opponent down to the tatami that is the floor covered with mats and hold him or her down .
If you can hold him down for 30 or more seconds you'll score an ippon and win the competition .
Ippon means one poin .
If you can hold him or her down for 25-30 seconds , you'll get a waza ari 2 waza aris equal an ippon .
For 20-25 seconds of holding down , you'll get a yuko .
If such case lasts only 10-20 , you'll get a Koka .
These terms are really hard to understand .
By the way if they break some rules . What will be the punishment .
The punishment varies according to the degree of the foul .
The most common include note caution-warning and Disqualification the technical terms for them are shido chui keikoku and hansokumake respectivel .
They sound very interesting .
Virgil . It's the first time for me , watching a taekwondo competitio .
Can you tell me some basic rules about it .
Oka .
First , you should know that taekwondo was derived from the ancient oriental martial arts and courtesy is a very important tenet .
So the referee asks the competitors to bow to one another before each contest begin .
It's funny .
Each bout is contested over 3-3 minute rounds with a minute's recess in between .
Points are scored by landing punches and kicks .
Punches and kicks .
Yes .
Both hand and foot can be applied to attack and defense .
Punches must be landed with the index and middle finger knuckles of the fis .
When kicking some part of the foot below the ankle must strike the opponent in a scoring area .
What are the scoring areas in taekwond .
The scoring areas are the head the abdomen and each side of the body .
How is the winner decided .
There are 3 ways of winning a contest that is by knocking out the opponent by outscoring the opponent or by defaul .
What do you mean by by default .
It occurs . If the opponent incurs 3 point penalties or is disqualified .
Basically taekwondo has 2 kinds of penalties kyong go and gam jeo .
Kyong go means a warning or half point deduction and gam jeom means a one-point deduction .
I see . Thank you .

Horse racing isn't just a sport . It's also a big business .
Recently a Derby winner was sold for £15 million so a great deal of care and effort goes into training and looking after horses .
Betsy , how would you describe your job .
Well , mainly we look after the horses ride them out .
Are you a Stable Girl .
Yes .
Are you in charge of the horses .
Yes .
Right .
Do you mostly have flat racers or jumpers .
Being a small yard we have dual purpose horses that can win on the flat and win over jumps as well .
Does that make the racing season longer .
More or less all the year round . Yes .
I see .
Because when the Flat season finishes jumping's started so that takes you through the winter .
How early . Do you have to get up in the morning .
About  .
We come in , we check the horses have eaten up you muck them out and then you get your tack on and you take them out , you bring them up to the downs and you work them .
You take them BACK they get FED . Then you have your breakfast and then you come out and do it all over again till you're finished .
And what about the day before a race .
Does a horse get a lot of exercise o .
Well it's gradually worked u .
They work with the trainer so that he knows how much work to give a horse and they gradually work up until the day before they race until they're fi .
And what about the day after .
Oh they stay i .
They just get led out for a short while .
And that's an easy day an easy day for a couple of days .
David , at what age is a horse ready to race .
He's ready to race when he's a 2-year-old .
He would normally be bought at about 18 months old .
He's then broken in which means introducing him to tack saddle bridle and eventually a rider on his bac .
And once he's used to that . He then goes along with other 2 year olds till they get used to going together and then they gradually do faster , faster and faster work until they're ready to be introduced to the race course .
How do you monitor its progress .
Rally by eye and through the boys that ride them .
They know they get the feel of it .
They can tell if an animal is backward and you can see by the way it works at home . Whether or not it's ready to run or whether it needs a bit more tim .
Do you have a special feeding program .
Yes . The horses are fed a basic diet of oats nuts and a few extra vitamins .
What about the horses' health .
Well I check the horses in the morning and I also see them at night .
Normally a horse will tell you itself whether it's well just by looking at it .
Is its coat well .
Has it got a bit of sparkle about i .
Is its eye bright .
Just natural things .
You can also look to see if the horse has eaten its food .
If it has then it's probably healthy .
You would also check it for worms every now and again check its teeth and that sort of thing .
Or a horse might have minor cuts which can be dealt with by antiseptic lotions powders disinfectant sprays etc .
Do you become very close to the horse .
Yes , you have to be very close to them .
It's important to try and get to know them individually so that you can get the best out of them .
The stable boys must become very attached to the horses , too .
Yes , I think that's right .
I mean obviously if a boy is looking after a horse that is winning him races and he's a character , or a friendly sort of a horse , then he's going to become attached to him .
All the horses get looked after equally . But there are bound to be favorites .
That's unavoidabl .
Solomon . What do you think is unique in equestrian .
The equality between men and women in participation and the communication and harmony between the rider and the horse .
But , men and women are equal in almost all Olympic events .
What's special about equestrian .
Equestrian is the only one of the Olympic sports that doesn't specify which event is accessible or which event is inaccessible to women .
Even any team of the team events can consist of both sexes .
It's a policy of real equality and it's unique indeed .
Another thing unique is that equestrian emphasizes the harmony between human beings and animal .
Whether it is dressage show jumping or 3-day event , good results won't occur unless the rider and the horse cooperate well .
You are right .
If the rider and the horse lack communication and harmony between each other . It's impossible to achieve such wonderful movements as can compare with those elegant ballet performances .
And the horse might refuse or even run out in front of the obstacles .
How do the equestrian rules define fall anyway .
A rider is considered to have fallen when he or she is separated from his horse .
And a horse is considered to have fallen when both its shoulder and quarters have touched the ground simultaneousl .
I think a fall will always be penalized .
The total score will be lowered .

Modern gymnastics were largely the creation of Friedrich Ludwig Jahn in the 19th century .
The German national invented . Many of the apparatus that are still used today the rings the parallel and horizontal bars the horse and the balance beam .
Trampoline and Tumbling can be traced to archeological drawings in ancient China Egypt and Persi .
Over the years , a number of methods have been devised to allow men and women to gain time in the air and perform a variety of skills .
Some historians believe the first trampoline dates back to the Alaskan Inuits as early as the mid-18 zeros . Others suggest that the pioneers are really circus acrobats who have used devices resembling trampolines for at least 200 year .
While the device was used to train soldiers and astronauts the trampoline was growing into a sport . By the mid-1950s .
Great Britain held the first televised national championships in 1958 and 6 years later . London hosted the first world championships .
The following year the International trampoline Federation was formally recognized and the first European Championship was held in Paris in 1969 .

The 3 players in the back row are called left back center back and right back .
Players have to be in their correct rotational positions until the serve is executed .

Ironically , although the game was invented in the United States . Americans have watched other countries such as Japan , China , Brazil , the former Soviet Union and Cuba play a leadership role in its development .
The popularity of the game was enhanced greatly when the Japanese added it to the Olympic Games program in 196 .
Under the old scoring system in volleyball the length of a match could vary from 1 hour to 4 hours .
The variance in time caused great reluctance on the part of the media , especially TV to cover the event .
Recent changes have made the game more attractive for media coverage .
A smart setter can constantly keep the opponents guessing by varying the attack tactics .
As with the dig a good deal of successful blocking is based on the player's ability to read the opponent's attack .
Single blocking in volleyball is often not enough .
Teams often join 2 or 3 players together forming double or triple blocks referred to as multiple blocks .
International caliber volleyball players are tall with quick reflexes and powerful arms .
In 1984 world ranking placed China in the number one spot , and the US number 2 .
But for the US to capture the gold and displace China from its throne . The Americans must be mighty sharp .
China was an awesome squad .
Chinese sensation Lang Ping led their offensive force with her brilliant spiking power .
In the early '80s China demonstrated that not only did they play with the quickness of the Asian school but they also had the power to terminate with unstoppable kills most of which came from the best player of all times Lang Pin .
US coach Arie Selinger pointed out that top line American players were injured including Rita Crockett a 5-8 hitter who only weeks earlier had undergone Knee Surgery Debbie Green , the team's best setter who was recovering from a dislocated Ankle and Julie Vollersten who has also undergone knee surgery .
The American team was no match for the gold medalists China at whose hands they suffered a straight-sets defeat .
The USA had to settle for silver ahead of the Japanese tea .
The men's tournament was won by the USA after they managed a 3-0 victory over silver medalists Brazil .
The Italians finished in bronze medal positio .
Jennifer had 10 kills and 8 blocks for her team .
Beach volleyball made its debut in Atlanta in 1996 but its popularity as a competitive sport began in the 1950s .
The United States and Brazil have dominated the scene all along .
Beach volleyball does not allow substitutes .
2 players play on each side .
The Brazilians proved unbeatable except by one another they walked off with gold and silver .
Yugoslav's male volleyball team gained revenge for their defeat by Russia , in the first match of the Games by cruising to the gold medal in straight set .
They crushed the Russians , 25-22 25-22 25-20 to reverse the 4-set loss inflicted upon them a week ago .
Unlike Russia or the other top-level teams Yugoslavia didn't have a stand out hitter to rely on for easy points .
Yugoslavia got to the Championship by being mentally stronger than world champion Italy finding a way and the will to win the close points .
They did the same against Russia .
The Russians behind sensational hitter Roman Yakovlev led 21-20 in the first game and were tied at 22 in the second but Yugoslavia pulled away both times .
After it was over Grbic stripped to his underwear and wrapped the Yugoslav flag around his waist .
After winning medals in its first 6 Olympics including gold in 1964 , 1,966 and 1,980 the Russians slumped to 7th in Barcelona and 4th in Atlanta .
The underdog team of the tournament . Peru squeaked its way to the final with not one but 3-5 set comeback victories in all matches , but one .
Meanwhile the USSR , which had lost 17-19 in the 5th to Japan in pool play went on to leave the world aghast by blanking then top world power China in the semifinal .
Gold again for Cuba in an amazing tournament that featured exciting matches and an underdog team that nearly stole the show the USA .
From being a team of rookies just some years ago coach Mick Haley assembled a team with last-minute changes .
The Russians and the Japanese were the 2 world powers in volleyball Up until the 1980 .
The former was a typical example of power volleyball where sheer physical size was the dominant FACTOR , the latter used the opposite quicker plays in order to outpace their physically bigger European opponents .
The history of hockey can date back to thousands ago .

Let's get a few people together for a half-court bullfight .

Why is a half-court bullfight so popular .
Basketball was deliberately created in 1891 by a physical education teacher in Massachusetts Canadian-born James Naismith to provide an indoor sports activity during the snowy winter months when outdoor playing fields could not be used .
Dr. Naismith's original 13 rules were the foundation of what is now the most watched indoor sport in the worl .
In recent times , a new rule requires a team to try to score within a brief time 35 seconds in the collegiate game 30 seconds in international play and 24 seconds in American professional play .
Team USA's semifinal game against the hometown Chinese team that featured 2 NBA caliber 7-footers in Wang Zhizhi and Yao Ming proved to be heartbreaking .
The Dallas Mavericks made Wang Zhizhi its second-round pick of the 1999 draft and secured his release from the Chinese army's Bayi Rockets paving the way for him to become the first Asian player in NBA history .
A 46-game winning streak for the US men's basketball team at the university games ended when Yao Ming of China blocked Melvin Ely's put back to preserve an 83-82 victory in Beijing .
The Shanghai team took advantage of a slew of Jiangxi turnovers .
Yao had foul trouble throughout and eventually fouled out only 110 into the second half .
He has the ability to sidestep opponents and to make prodigious leaps , blocking shots and grabbing rebounds .
China finished 4th in the pool , guaranteeing its best Olympic finish ever and a stark improvement over a 12th and last-place finish at Barcelona .
In 1979-2 college players : Larry Bird of Indiana State University and Magic Johnson of Michigan State University motivated an increased interest in the game through their friendly rivalry .
Jordan seems to have gotten himself into superb shape having shed at least 30 pounds to get near his last playing weight of 212 and he is as strong as ever .
The Wizards will probably play well one night horribly the next frequently earning their leader Michael Jordan's anger then his wrath then maybe his rage .
Of all the records and distinctions that Wilt Chamberlain has one stands out because it is so Unexpected he played in 1205 games , regular season and playoffs and never fouled out unbelievable given what a physical presence . He was .
The heavily favored Los Angeles Sparks got a jump on their bid for their first WNBA title getting 24 points and 8 rebounds from Lisa Leslie in a 75-66 victory over the Charlotte sting in Game 1 of League finals Thursday night .
Leslie showed why she was the MVP of both the regular season and the All Star Game with a dominating second-half performance to rally the sparks from an 11-point deficit .
Most fans sip a cold drink or possibly dip into a large bag of popcorn , while watching the women's teams race back and forth on the court .
In March , 64 winning university teams from the conferences around the United States are matched against each other in a single game elimination series called March Madness .
One team was stealing the ball and running the length of the court for a layup . While the other was turning the ball ove .
Some types of misbehavior or unsportsmanlike actions either by the players or their coaches may bring down a technical foul , whereupon the team captain , is awarded a free throw .
Toward the end of the game much thought is given to strategies to stop the clock by the losing team and players are sometimes deliberately fouled in the hopes they will miss their free throws , thereby giving the other team a chance to score 2 or 3 points in a short period of time .
If the score is tied at the end of the regular game period additional overtime periods are played until one team emerges as the winner .

Britain has significantly fewer public courts than most other European countries . And as a result , significantly fewer top class players .
The last homegrown winner of Wimbledon was Fred Perry in the late 1930s .
Only recently after decades of mediocrity has Britain managed to find itself . A couple of tennis players capable of challenging for top honors .
If you and your children want to see some grass-court tennis and spot a few famous players you would be better off going to the Queen's tournament which takes place a couple of weeks before Wimbledo .
8th seed Marcelo Rios won the Salem Open at Hong Kong stopping Rainer Schuettler's winning streak at 9 matches with a 7-6 6-2 victory .
Tennis was a minor sport in Germany until a somewhat awkward carrot top by the name of Boris Becker won Wimbledon in 1985 at 17 years of age and became the youngest player first unseeded player and first German ever to do so .
In recent years . Becker has assumed a mentoring and coaching role with younger German talent like Thomas Haas and Nicolas Kiefer .
Steffi Graf has been the most consistently brilliant of all German tennis players perhaps of all players anywhere .
Stich won the Davis Cup for Germany but announced his retirement in 1997 aged 28 .
After injuries kept her off the courts for much of 1998 Steffi returned triumphantly to Paris to become the 1999 French Open champion and to Wimbledon where only Lindsay Davenport could stop her from winning her 8th Wimbledon titl .
Thanks largely to the success of Becker and Graf . Germany has become the biggest tennis market in the world , hosting plenty of top tennis tournament .
The men's outdoor season gets under way in Munich in late April , followed by the German Open in Hamburg in early May .
After a long period during which his career was in the doldrums Andre Agassi started the new millennium right on top of his game with a success in the men's singles in the Australian Open championship confirming his position at the top of the world rankings .
Davenport . The 1998 US Open champion surged back from a poor first set to force a tie-breaker in which she saved 2 match points .
Williams broke Davenport 5 times ran off a 3-0 lead in the 3rd set , won 89% of her net approaches and had 11 aces .
She got her first lead after going up 15-0 with Williams serving in the 9th game of the 3rd set and then created a break point .
Taking another huge step in his remarkable resurgence Pete Sampras edged longtime rival Agassi 6-7 7-6 7-6 7-6 in a quarterfinal thriller Wednesday night in the US Open .

In spite of its European origin ping pong achieved its greatest popularity in Asia .
Before China introduced market reforms in the early '80s its sports development was centered around table tennis .
As a result , from 1949 to 1,966 , when China set up its first State Sports Commission the nation won 13 world titles mostly in table tennis .
After the Helsinki Games the country's only international success continued to come from table tennis .
But this sport did help China come out from the cold .
Ping pong diplomacy between Chairman Mao and Richard Nixon , led to the resumption of ties between China and the United States .
And in 1979 , China was reinstated in the IOC .

Football known as soccer . In American English is the most popular sport in the world .
Women's teams didn't become part of the Olympic program until 1996 at Atlant .

Number 5 bent a ball around the defense wall .
He displayed admirable skills in passing dribbling and heading .
What impresses me most is that the goalkeeper is very skilled at catching high balls saving shots and diving at the opponent's feet .
The linesmen tell the referee which team should be awarded a throw in a corner kick or a goal kic .
They frequently committed off sides and fouls .
Argentina takes the 4-3-3 formation while Brazil takes 4-4-2 so Argentina is more aggressive .

I like the way the visiting team is playing .
The teamwork is good and the players are in excellent trim .
Yes , they play an attacking game .
At times they Gain Ground , but the defense of the home team is well organized .
The scoring was opened after 15 minutes' play by the center-forward of the home team .
So the first game ended in a draw .
It was 1-1 dra .

The visiting team was no match for the home team .
What is the name of the world governing body of football .
FIFA is the world governing body of football .
The object of soccer is to drive the ball past the opposing goalkeeper into the goal for a score worth 1. .
If no goals are scored or the teams are tied at the end of regular play the game can be decided by a kick from the penalty spot or extra playing time .
The fullback is not a glamor position as offensive opportunities are rare and defensive mistakes get magnified .
Today soccer known as football everywhere in the world except in North America is the most frequently played and most popular of all team sports .
Soccer game arrived in Brazil just before the turn of the 20th century but the sport soon spread across the nation like wildfire .
Soccer fans around the world were enthralled by the fluid attacking skillful ball handling and clever playmaking of the Brazilians during their finals matches in Mexico .
In a game played and loved in hundreds of nations across the world . Brazil , 4-time winner of the World Cup is preeminent .
The dark age of Chinese soccer under the old state-run system was the 1980s most memorably a 1,985 loss to lightweights Hong Kong , then a British colony that led angry fans to smash cars and start fires .
China finally began to wean their players off state dependency with the introduction of club soccer in 1994 following the example of Japan a year before .
China reached the World Cup finals for the first time on Sunday by beating Oman one-0 in an Asian qualifier , setting off a frenzy of celebration by hundreds of millions of ecstatic soccer fans around the country .
The victory was glorious redemption for China's soccer team , which had become a national embarrassment after failing 6 times to reach the World Cup finals .
China's 57-year-old Croatian coach boar Milutinovic a master at shepherding lesser soccer nations to World Cup success was elated .
Milutinovic 57 has borne the brunt of China's World Cup anxieties .
He made headlines by vowing to jump off the Great Wall . If his team stumbled .
As China prepared for its first World Cup finals was clear that Milutinovic's methods had paid dividends .
In women's soccer , Wang Xiaoying of Jinan on a breakaway fired a shot toward the goal in the second overtime period , but the ball went over the crossbar as Jinan settled for a zero-0 tie against Nanjing .
That 18-year-old played left fullback so her teammates relied on her throughout the game to defend against pressure win the ball restart the attack and know when to go forwar .
Toward the end of the game . Her teammate Xiao Huang curled a free-kick around a defensive wall and past goalkeeper Li Linmei .
17 minutes into the first half Fan Zhiyi scored on a free kick .
30 seconds later he scored again this time on a header .
London is home to over a dozen professional football clubs . The biggest of which are Arsenal , Chelsea and Nottingha .
The removal of the hooligan element in the late '80s has led to more families coming to matches .
The most successful football players have become superstars commanding 7-figure salaries while the top clubs are now stock market listed businesse .

Now Wang Nan is leading Li Ju by 8 to 5 .
What just happened to the forward on the visitor's side .
He's had a foul called against him .
Yes . But what did he do .
He tripped the fullback of the home team .
Hasn't Dalian scored yet .
No our forwards have missed so many opportunities to score .
What a pity , but it seems that the best forward number 9 isn't here . Why not .
He got suspended for this game .
This national sports meet is worth watching .
Well , that's true .
It has produced a host of new Asian and Chinese records .
I'm most impressed by the girl who won the championship in the 100 meter dash .
Well she broke 3 world records . This time , It's really an amazing achievement for a girl of 18 .
I didn't expect the visiting team to win the match .
According to the papers the visiting side was a strong team in Asia .
But the home team also did a good job .
Yes but they seemed to lack luck today .
I think the score of 1-1 didn't do us justice .
I hope our team won't disappoint us in the second half .
I hope so too but I don't think our center forward poses any threat up front .
We should get a replacement for him .
Who is the man in the second lane . Do you know .
You mean the man in the lead .
He is MA Ming , a gold medal winner .
I like the 100-meter relay best .
Me too , it's always one of the highlights of the match .
Which team do you think will win .
Liaoning team of COURSE it's the best team in China .
That little girl is holding a safe lead .

I'm going to watch the football final This Evening Would you like to come with me .

In our country . Football is the most popular sport and a constant topic of conversatio .
Let's walk to the stadiu .
A bit of exercise will do us good .
Look , the match is going to start . It's between our university team and the Trade Union Football Club .
The referee is calling the Captains to the center spot for the toss .
Up , goes the coin .
It seems their captain's won the toss and they've chosen to defend the southern end .
The ball is going out of play for a goal kick to our team .
Our goalkeeper is running up placing the ball and booting it off to number 9 .
Our defense seems to be well organize .
Now number 9 is taking the ball forward quickly cutting in towards their goal .
Their center half comes across and tries to intercept him .
But he slips past and pushes the ball out to number 5 . Our center forward .
Look , number 5 jumps and gets his head to it and oh , what a beautiful goal .
Well , this is the first goal , we've opened the scoring .
There goes the referee's whistle for a foul .
I think it must be that heavy tackle by their right back on our number 7 .
Now the referee is placing the ball for a free kick .
A goal : It's a goa .
That's really a perfect goa .
He's got another point for us .
That puts us one point ahead .
How people are cheering at their wonderful team work .
They did spend quite some time practicing every DAY they've improved greatly their speed and tactics .
There goes the referee's whistle for the end of the match .
The final score is 2 to 1 in our favor .
The score was tied 1 to 1 when the first half was over .
Both teams have the same score . The score is tied .
Both teams have shown good sportsmanship .
The hardest thing to learn is to be a good loser .
A beautiful center .
A beautiful corner kick .
A beautiful heading .
A clever pass to the forward .
A fumble .
A goa .
A wonderful passing he di .
The ball's got into the net .
Bond has just missed an open goal .
Carson was offside .
Dynamo hasn't scored ye .
Emerson kicked it deep into Columbia territory .
Gordon's near the penalty area .
He's got hold of the ball out on the touch line .
He's making a dash toward the goa .
He's pushing lovely passes up the middle and out to the wings .
He's now trying for a goal .
Hey what's wrong with the fullbacks on the visiting side .
How did Fellows shape at center-hal .
Is Jack playing .
Is this the last 15 minutes .
It's half time no .
Sydney's defender is tackling Thoma .
Look the visiting side's center forward has got the bal .
There's a man running up the left wing .
Number 5 has got suspended this time .
Number 4 is bringing the ball almost to corner flag .
Number 6 gave a long shot , but missed the goal .
Number 3 headed home a pass from number 2 .
Now it's Melbourne's turn to attack .
Now , Jones is marking Pixon closely .
Now number 6 , is running up to intercept .
Now the referee's placing the ball for a free-kick to the visiting tea .
Now their inside right forward is dribbling .
Offside play .
Oh . Their goalkeeper just didn't stand a chance with that one .
Oh they're rushing for the ball .
Oh what beautiful goa .
Outside .
Pass it . Tom .
Shoot .

That's really a perfect goal .

The Australia players are warming up for a few minutes on the field .
The goalkeeper got the ball and booted it half way across the field .
The inside-left is passing the opposing side's fullback line .

There goes the referee's whistl .
They're lining up in position for the kickoff .
They've built a wall of players for a penalty shot .
They've opened the scoring .
Well done .
Well his header missed .
According to the papers the visiting side is a strong team in Europe .
Actually , they were given several chances by the united only they didn't succeed in scorin .
But that last goal was unfair .
Sydney's defense looks disorganize .
Good job . They've got a replacement for him .
I don't think their center forward poses any threat up front .
I hope our home side won't disappoint us in the second half .
I suppose it all depends on how they shap .
I think it's simply a matter of the attack being weakened .
I think 2 one , didn't do them justice .
If they beat the visiting team . They'll be the champio .
I'm doubtful of the team's chances in the match .
It was silly of him to take a wild swipe at the ball and sky it miles over the bar .
It's a narrow victory margin .
Maybe Melbourne's side will score the first goal .
Oh , that was really a close game .
Our forwards were asleep in the second half .
Our team were hopeles .
Pity , really because he's not a rough player normally .
That was a good kick .
Their defense seems to be well organize .
Their left half plays roug .
There were some bad misse .
They don't often have a bad day .
They haven't got a proper shot at the goal in the first half .
They just can't cash in on their opponents' lack of form .
They looked enterprising from the first minute of the kick-off .

The main aim in badminton is simply to hit the shuttlecock to the floor on the opponent's side of the net .
A fault is an infringement that ends a rall .
If the serving side makes a fault the service passes to the other side , if the receiving side makes a fault the serving wins the point .
In doubles and men's singles this total is 15 Points in women's singles . It is 11 points .
A match is won by the first side to win 2 game .
Modern soccer is a sport that was devised by the British refined by Scottish players and coaches .
Soccer is played on a field of 100 110m 64 75m .
The size of the goal is set at 7.34m wide and 2.44m high .
2 teams are involved in the game . 11 players from each team can be on the field playing at any one tim .
A goal is made by shooting the ball into the goal with any part of your body except hands .
Only the goalkeeper is permitted to use his hands in the goal area .
The 90-minute game is divided into 45-minute halves with an interval of 15 minutes .
When 2 teams get tied at the end of the 90-minute game whether to adopt a play off or not depends on the competition system .
Few people if asked could name a single country where soccer isn't played watched and enjoyed .
Soccer is a religion in many regions where the fortunes of teams excite passions reserved for few other things in life .
Results matter .
Soccer is fast and has dramatic ACTION it utilizes individual skill within a team framework .
These characteristics have helped to spread the game rapidly since the last century .
The game is not restricted by social or cultural boundaries .
On the contrary , it has become a link between societies .
The World Cup is a prime example of such unity .
Soccer is the world's common language , perhaps even more so than music .
As the legendary Liverpool club manager Bill Shankly was to say , Some people think that soccer is a matter of life and death . It's more serious than that .
One of the first things that people studying English learn is that the game they call football is called soccer in North America .
Soccer has been popular for more than 100 years and today it is probably the most popular sport in the world .
Every 4 years , teams from all over the world compete in the famous World Cup .
The Cup is a series of games in which teams from many countries play to see which is the best .
By one estimate , almost one billion people watched the 1982 championship game on television .
People in Asia had to get up in the middle of the night to see Italy beat West Germany on TV in a game played in Spain .
The World Cup began in Montevideo Uruguay in 193 .
At the time it did not seem like a true world competition since only 13 teams decided to play and 8 of them were from South America .
The team from Uruguay won .
In 1934 and 1,938 the Cup , was held in Europe .
More than 30 teams played in each of these competitions and Italy won both of them .
The larger number of teams meant that some rules had to be changed .
There were too many teams playing so they had to have elimination matches first .
Some of the games were played in countries other than host countries . This system is still used today and only the 16 teams left after elimination actually compete for the Cup .
There were no World Cup championships in 1942 or 1,946 because of World War II The Cup itself was hidden during the wa .
This beautiful cup is about 10 inches high and has the shape of Nike the Greek goddess of victory on it . It is named for a person who helped organize the World Cup . Jules Rime .
When the cup play started again in 1950 , there was little enthusiasm It was like 1,928 all over again , only 13 teams competed . The games were in Brazil and Uruguay won .
But the worldwide interest in soccer came back during the next 4 YEARS : By the time West Germany won in Switzerland in 1954 , millions of people wanted to go to the matche .
In 1958 when the games were held in Sweden interest was once again very HIGH 53 teams wanted to compete .
Many elimination matches were held in different parts of the world to get the number of teams down and only the last 16 teams went to Swede .
This was the first time that the world saw Pele his team from Brazil won the Cup for the first time that year and Pele become the greatest soccer player of all time .
In the past 30 years soccer has become the sport of the WORLD each World Cup is more successful than the las .
Since 1966 probably one quarter of the world has listened to or watched the championship gam .
In the 1970s Pele retired from the national team of Brazil and became a professional player for a team in New Yor .
Soccer wasn't very popular in the United States at that time , few North Americans knew about this fast moving spor .
There was no money to pay professional players and there was little interest in soccer in the high schools and colleges .
When Pele and other international stars began playing in various US cities people saw how interesting . The game was and began to go to the matches .
Today there is a professional league called the North American Soccer Leagu .
It is common for important games to have 50 to 60,000 fans .
Support from the fans is important to soccer .
The fans cheer enthusiastically for their favorite players and teams who respond by playing better than before .
In most World Cups . The home team or the team from the host country usually plays better than most people expect .
In 1966 , 1,974 and 1,978 . The home team of England West Germany and Argentina all won the World Cup .
It is common for people to close their stores and stop working during game .
Some people feel that their national soccer team represents their country's honor .
North American teams have never been as good as teams from other parts of the world . But this may change .
Many North American high schools and colleges , now have teams and student interest is high .
Fans in the United States enjoy sports which are hard and fast and US interest in soccer play will surely grow .
As all soccer fans know the greatest teams don't always win .
Their fans' enthusiasm and their own desires sometimes help teams play better than normal .
In the 1950 World Cup . For example , most people thought that the team from England was the best in the WORLD . The US team surprised everyone by winning its match .
That loss stopped England from winning the Cup .
This of course did not mean that the US team was the best in the WORLD . The United States lost to Chile in its next game then the Chilean team lost to Spain and Spain finished 4th in the final result Uruguay won the Cu .
The World Cup is called that because teams from every continent have played in it . However , since the Cup began , all of the winning teams have been from Europe or South America .
Teams from Asia or Africa always do well but they haven't yet won .
Mexico played surprisingly well in the 1970 Cup which it hosted . But it wasn't among the final 4 teams .
The largest crowd ever to attend a soccer match was at the World Cup final in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , on July 16 , 1950 , one hundred and 99-854 fans watched Uruguay defeat Brazil by a score of 2- .
The following incidents show how serious , some people are about soccer .
During the 1960s a player for a team from Derby , England , was fined $2 for smiling at a referee during a match .
In another incident in Greece a referee feared an angry crowd after match so he dressed himself as a Catholic priest and tried to escape to Athens by SHIP the fans found out where he was and threw fruit at him before his ship sailed .
American football not to be confused with the football called soccer is the American national sport .
It developed from the British game of rugby and although it is played in no other country in the world . It excites tremendous enthusiasm .
Intercollegiate games are great social Occasions more than 100,000 mothers and fathers , brothers and sisters , students and football fans from the general public crowd into the huge luxurious stadium .
During a recent college final in the Rose Bowl at Pasadena , California . There were severe earthquake tremors but nobody notice .
Then there is the razzamatazz the splendidly trained brass bands , the teams of pretty girls twirling batons and dressed in fancy costumes who march like well drilled soldiers during the half time show the cheerleaders , urging the fans to shout encouragement or applaud good pla .
The method of scoring in American Football is the same as in rugby players try to carry the ball over the opponents' line and then to earn more points by kicking the ball between the upright goal posts above the bar .
But that is where the likeness between the 2 games ends .
American football has a reputation for being a brutal and dangerous GAME this reputation is not really deserved .
The players hurl themselves at each other fiercely but today their uniforms and helmets are so skillfully padded that there are few serious injurie .
By comparison , the rugby player is almost naked having only a thin jersey and a pair of shorts to protect him from his opponents' boots and tackling .
The football coach is a very important member of the college staff more important than the professors , some sa .
The coach picks promising football players from the high schools and recommends that they be given scholarships .
This is the only way some boys from poor families with no intellectual background can get to college .
Quite a few of these students go on to become professional football players .
The names of professional football clubs are as well known to Americans as professional soccer clubs are to Europeans and South American .
The Americans are addicted to craze , when they take something up , they do so wholeheartedly and often the rest of the world follows their lea .
Jogging is an example of this .
The Americans now have another craze , a game which most other countries call football but which they call socce .
Soccer is spreading like wildfire through all the States and gaining in popularity on basebal .
It is being run by big businesses and the TV Public they are employing famous fashion designers to design novel uniforms for the PLAYERS they have introduced a musical background to the games and there is a big screen in the stadium which explains to spectators that is happening .
Most important , they have hired at enormous expense famous coaches and players from Europe and South Americ .
They have also changed some of the rules , including the offside rules to make the game more exciting .
Soccer games can now draw crowds of over 70,000 in cities where baseball attracts a mere 20,000 spectators .
The soccer stadiums are much more luxurious than the vast majority of European and South American league grounds .
There is a seat for everyone and a parking lot for 25,000 cars .
Soccer is being brilliantly promoted like any other promising American product .
The lean figure at the end of the runway tried to calm his angry nerves .
These were the Olympic Games and soon . It would be his moment to take center stage .
With his thoughts focused on simply doing his best he had no idea that he was about to be at the center of a freak moment in sports history .
But conditions were all coming together for him at just the right time .
All that lay between the takeoff board and the end of the long jump pit was the thin air of Mexico City .
At such a high altitude , the air would give less resistance to his jump than at lower elevations .
And there was a gentle tailwind that would push him slightly through the ai .
At the time of his jump this breeze would reach 2m per second .
If it increased even slightly the jump would be considered wind-aided and it would not count as a world record .
Bob Beamon would not have been the logical choice for this historic moment .
He was a good jumper but he did not rank with the greatest .
During these 1,968 Olympics , he had barely dodged disaster and had qualified for the finals only on his last preliminary jump .
There were many other jumpers with better form who were more consistent than Bob .
While others pranced down the runway with carefully measured strides Beamon was not always sure whether he would be jumping off his left foot or his righ .
Now it was time for Beamon to jump .
When he tore off down the runway . He seemed to be driven by an extra burst of energy .
After running faster than he had ever before in his life . Bob hit his takeoff perfectly and soared .
He didn't splash into the sand until he was dangerously near the end of the pit .
Aware of what had happened . The crowd screamed its approval .
When he heard that his distance had been 8.9m Beamon clapped his hands over his eyes collapsed and kissed the ground .
In the words of a competitor Beamon had destroyed the event .
Knowing their best efforts would look foolish compared to Beamon's the rest of the jumpers could hardly fire up for their turns .
The United States' jumper had sailed 29 feet 2.5in almost 2 feet beyond the old world record .
Some called it the greatest achievement in athletic history and predicted the record would last well into the next century .
3 years later , a 10-year-old boy took a tape measure out into his yard .
Stretching out the tape he carefully measured 29 feet 2.5in , on the grass .
Young Carl Lewis looked from one end of the mark to the other eyes huge with wonder that a human could jump so far .
Although he did not realize it Carl was sizing up the task that was in front of him .
In 10 years he would begin a relentless assault on that untouchable record .
Several years later Carl met his dad's hero Jesse Owens .
The Buckeye bullet from Ohio State University , had been the greatest track and field star in United States' history .
It was Owens , who had shocked Adolf Hitler's powerful German team in the 1936 Olympics by winning 4 gold medals in track and field .
As he shook hands with the great Owens Lewis stared into the face of a second legend .
No man had ever challenged Owen's record of 4 gold medals in track and field in one Olympics .
Like the legendary jump of Bob Beamon . The legend of Jesse Owens was so great that only Carl Lewis would consider going after i .
If a mad scientist tried to use principles of inherited traits to create a spectacular sprinter and leaper he might well have considered pairing a couple from Tuskegee Institute in Alabama .
Evelyn Lawler was ahead of her time in women's sports .
She devoted full effort to such activities as basketball and track and had placed 6th in the hurdles during the 1951 Pan American Games .
Had it not been for an injury Lawler would have had a good chance of competing in the 1952 Olympic .
The man she married William McKinley Lewis played football and competed in the sprints and the long jump for Tuskegee .
Both enjoyed Athletics so much that they planned to make careers out of coaching and teaching physical education .
A Hollywood writer dreaming up a birthplace for the person who would challenge Jesse Owens might place him in Owen's home state of Alabam .
Carl Lewis in fact was born in Alabama , the 3rd of the Lewis' 4 childre .
At the age of 2 Carl went along with his family to Willingboro , New Jersey , where his parents had found jobs teaching and coaching for rival high schools .
Bill and Evelyn Lewis cared so much about their favorite sport track and field that they used their own money to organize a Track Club in Willingbor .
The 4 Lewis children all benefited from their parents' dedication to sports .
Although they were never pushed into competing they were influenced by their parents' enthusias .
Mackie the oldest was a sprinter who set a county record for the 220-yard das .
Cleve polished his skills in soccer so well that he became the first American black ever drafted by the pros and played 2 seasons with the Memphis rogues .
Carol , a year younger than Carl seemed to the best athlete of all .
Blessed with a limitless supply of energy . She kept up with Carl so well that her brother included her as one of his gan .
Her excellent coordination and fearless nature combined to scare her parents half to death .
She and Carl would try nearly any running climbing or jumping trick regardless of the risk .
Carl and Carol hung closely together all through childhood .
When Carl began taking cello lessons Carol started right in on the violin .
When their parents headed out to the track , Carl and Carol tagged along to play in the sand of the long jump pit .
Carl first became interested in jumping at age 9 when his dad brought home a load of sand for a patio Foundation .
In the minds of the Lewis children sand was for jumping and they made their own long jump pit out of the patio san .
Soon even the beach became their glorified long jump pi .
Carl and Carol would carefully build sand castles and then back off and take running leaps to smash them .
Hurdles too were a basic toy for the Lewis family .
Carl and Carol would often set up a course of makeshift hurdles in their back yard .
One problem that arose , however was that Carl was not the athlete Carol was .
Small for his age he frequently lost when racing his younger siste .
Privately , Bill and Evelyn thought Carl might be the non-athlete of the family .
For the most part he could handle his defeats without bitterness .
But every so often his resentment came to the surfac .
I'm tired of losing he once complained to his da .
He was told that he would just have to work harder at winning or else quit .
So Carl continued to plug away at sports , especially long jumping .
Long jumping doesn't normally attract many young children and it was the unpopularity of the spot that appealed to Carl .
Instead of waiting his turn to practice with a mob of sprinters Carl could practice long jumping without having to take turn .
In a way it was twice as fun as sprinting because a long jumper got to Sprint and jump on the same turn .
Only in the Lewis family could a boy like Carl have been considered a non-athlete .
By the end of the 9th grade , he was jumping 22 feet , a mark that few high school seniors can reach .
He was gaining that distance with his remarkable jumping form , however , not with outstanding speed or strength and his times in the sprints and hurdles were nothing outstanding .
Meanwhile Carl's refusal to listen to coaches made going much farther in sports doubtfu .
Nature then stepped in to change Carl's life completely , and he started to gain the inches and muscles that he needed to improve his performance .
After sprouting nearly 3 inches during one year in high school . Carl no longer lost races .
He owned a best time of 10.6 seconds in the 100-yard dash at the start of his junior year , and with his new size and strength immediately dropped that to an eye-catching 9.8 .
Now Carl wanted to concentrate on sprinting and drop the hurdles .
Fine , said his coach . If you can get your 100 time down to 9.5 . You won't have to run any more hurdles .
By the end of the season . Lewis had sped through a race in 9.3 .
In the long jump . However , Carl ran into problems more serious than occasional squabbles with coaches .
While he was steadily improving his distances . He was just as steadily ruining his career .
Carl's style of jumping high in the air put far too much strain on his leg .
While still in high school , his knees swelled up so badly that he had to skip practices .
He could still get some remarkable jumps on those knees during meets but there was a danger he could cause more serious damage to them .
True , he could set an American high school record of 26 feet 8 inches , and he did finish 3rd in the 1979 Pan American Games .
But would his legs last long enough for him to reach his tremendous potential .
By now , Lewis had made up his mind to try to zero in on the feats of those 2 track legends Beamon and Owens .
As part of his plan he enrolled at the University of Houston .
There he would come under the guidance of Tom Tellez , one of track's most knowledgable coaches .
The combination of a tough-minded coach and a notoriously independent athlete seemed dangerous and some of Carl's high school coaches might have expected that situation to explode .
Tellez seemed to be asking for trouble when he told Carl to scrap the jumping-style he had spent years perfecting .
Even the most coachable athletes often have trouble getting used to changing their routines , especially if they have been successful .
And Lewis had turned his back on advice far less drastic than what Tellez was suggesting .
All Carl needed , however , was to be told why he should do something .
And Tellez had the knowledge to explain why Carl's leg wouldn't hold up to the strain of being slammed down at high speed .
The coach showed how Carl's problem was made worse by his attempts to get high in the air on his jumps .
Tellez insisted that speed was far more important than height in gaining distance .
Since Carl was an excellent sprinter , he had an advantage over other jumpers and Tellez said he should learn to use it .
The first step in improving Lewis' jumping was to have him stop jumping .
During his freshman year at Houston Carl was told to work on his sprinting and leave long jumping alone .
Only when his leg had fully healed was Lewis allowed to practice and to try out Tellez's new jumping methods .
To get an idea of how hard it is for a trained athlete to start over with a new technique imagine relearning to tie your shoes using only your thumbs and smallest fingers .
An athlete who was content with being one of the best would probably not bother trying to change .
But an athlete who was chasing legends as Lewis was would try almost anything to succeed .
As it turned out there was a great deal more to Carl Lewis than just natural speed and sprin .
He was also in his coach's worlds a physical geniu .
All Tellez had to do was to explain the mechanics of what needed to be done , such as how the arms and legs should be carried and what angle his takeoff should take and Carl was able to do it right the first time .
First Carl had to learn to practice only part of the long jump at a time .
His own injuries were proof of the surprising danger in what seemed to be a very simple exercise .
A world class long jumper may reach a speed greater than 25 miles per hour during his approach , and even the most experienced long jumper feels nervous when he plants his foot for the takeoff at that speed .
The impact can be brutal as Carl once showed when he sheared 2 metal spikes off his shoe during a jump .
Some doctors worried that if Lewis ever hit the takeoff board at his absolute top speed the impact could destroy his leg .
For this reason Carl rarely took a full running jump in practic .
If he were to jump at all , he would take only a short run before jumping .
Much of Lewis' practice time was spent in simply striding down the runway .
Since all long jumps are measured from the end of the takeoff board success depends on making sure the jumping foot always lands as near to the end of the board as possible .
For example , if a jumper takes off 10 inches behind the board he or she must actually sail 27 feet and 10 inches in order to get credit for a 27-foot jump .
But if even a sliver of the foot touches beyond the board a foul is declared and the jump is not measured .
Carl spent countless hours working on his stride so that even at high speed , he could almost automatically jump at precisely the spot he wanted .
With the help of his coach Carl found they could work up to his best long jumping speed in 23 strides .
Time after time . He practiced speeding down the runway , so that in those 23 strides he would travel exactly 168 feet .
Another crucial part of long jumping is the takeoff angle .
Floating high in the air . Like many long jumpers only slowed Carl down and wasted his energy .
To avoid this Carl tried to keep his leap much closer to the ground than that of other jumpers .
The danger in doing that , however , was that the momentum of his speed would naturally tend to spin his body into a somersault while he was in the ai .
The way to avoid flipping was to get the legs working against the spin during the jump .
And Carl did this by developing his famous double hitch kick .
When Carl was in the air , he looked like he was pretending to ride a bicycle .
The 2.5 pedals that he went through in the air . Not only helped him keep his balance . They also brought his legs into proper position for a landing .
This double hitch had to be practiced constantly until it was done by instinc .
As Carl noted once you hit the board . It's so quick . You can't remember i .
During his brief but wild 1.5 second trip through the air . On a full-fledged long jump attempt there would be no time to think about what he was supposed to be doing .
By the end of 1981 : Carl had developed his skills so well that opponents were already starting to give up hope of beating him .
That season , he took his first step on the road to catching a legend when he became the first man since Jesse Owens to win a national competition in both a track event running and a field event , jumping and throwing .
While breaking into the top ranks of the United States' 100 meter dash men Lewis established himself as the finest long jumper in the country .
In the 1981 National Collegiate Athletic Association championships Lewis was allowed to take 9 long jump .
Although he decided to skip 6 of his 9 attempts . He still ended up with the top 3 leaps in the competition .
Carl and Carol who had followed her brother to the University of Houston . A year later , could have made their school the top track power in the country , but it never turned out that way .
Although Carl had been doing well in his studies as a communications major he made the mistake of failing a history course .
For that error . He was declared ineligible to compete in his junior year .
Miffed Lewis simply turned his back on the college athletic program .
Although he continued to attend classes Lewis was through running for Housto .
It was Lewis' good fortune to gain fame when the rules governing amateur athletes were relaxed to the point of being ridiculous .
There were all kinds of ways that an athlete could be an amateur . A person who competes in sport for fun and not for profit .
When the word got out that Carl Lewis just might turn out to be one of the greatest track men of all time . Many sponsors stepped forward to make deals with him .
As a result , Carl could afford to live in an expensive house hire Tellez as his own private coach and still be eligible to compete in an amateur track meets all over the country .
The more success Lewis had particularly in the long jump . The higher he set his goals .
When he announced that he was serious about going after Bob Beamon's . Mexico City . Record : a great debate started among track and field experts about whether he had any chance of doing it .
After all , Wasn't That leap just a once in a century . Fluke .
Even the best long jumpers in the world seemed to think s .
Since that 1,968 record . No one had some close to 29 feet 2.5in .
In fact , they couldn't even reach 28 feet .
In all of his attempts , following his miracle jump Beamon himself never topped 27 feet .
The facts seemed to show he had somehow done the impossible .
But Carl and his coach , didn't see it that wa .
After proving himself as the United States' best jumper and sprinter Lewis needed a bigger challenge .
Deep inside himself he felt he was born to do something truly extraordinary .
God's given me the Talent . I'm just trying to be patient with it , he sai .
Breaking Beamon's record would certainly be an extraordinary feat .
Carl admitted he not only wanted to break it . He wanted to do it at sea level where the heavier air would make it more difficult .
And if pressed further he would confess that he thought there was a 30-foot jump inside of him just waiting to come out .
It did not take long for Carl to prove to a stunned track world that this was more than just idle talk .
On July 24 , 1982 in Indianapolis , Indiana . He roared down the long jump runway and struck the takeoff board as close to the end as was humanly possible .
There were gasps from the crowd as Carl jetted over a seemingly unending stretch of carefully leveled sand .
Just when it seemed he would crash out of the pit altogether his legs finally came down near the back of the sand box .
But the crowd's excitement turned to a groan and Carl's look of triumph melted into anguish when an official signaled that he had foule .
Many observers hotly disputed the call and pointed out that Carl had not disturbed the finely powdered substance spread just beyond the takeoff board to track any borderline fouls .
But the official's call stood and under the rules of track and field the jump would not even be measured .
Carl had to watch as the evidence of what was probably the longest jump in history even longer than Beamon's miracle leap of 1968 was raked away .
Experts studying film of Lewis' Indianapolis jump concluded that Carl could have jumped 29.5f .
Lewis himself thought he landed closer to 30 feet .
Although that leap was never officially measured it destroyed a myth about long jumping and showed that Beamon really had not reached the upper limit of human athletic abilit .
By breaking that mental barrier Carl gave long jumpers new goals to shoot for .
Larry Myricks , who had defeated Carl in the 1980 Olympic trials , one of the few long jumpers to defeat Lewis said Carl's jump makes it easier for all of us to go farther .
Instead of hoping to reach 27 feet in competition , Myricks and other jumpers now started looking toward 28 fee .
For those skeptics who thought reports of Carl's Indianapolis jump were exaggerated Lewis displayed a rash of 28-foot jumps .
Included among those was a best of 28 feet 10.25in , which was within 5 inches of Bob Beamon's sacred ground .
For his pioneering efforts in the event . Carl was named the 1982 Athlete of the Year by Track and Field . New .
While he was still nipping at the heels of one legend Carl took off after the other .
He often thought of Jesse Owens and his historic trick of 4 track and field gold medals in a single Olympics .
Having mastered , one of Owen's events the long jump Carl now turned his attention to the Buckeye bullet's other specialty the sprint .
As in long jumping Carl was willing to do whatever work was needed to make himself a successful sprinter , including scrapping his entire starting techniqu .
At 6 feet 2 inches Carl was fairly tall for a sprinter and tall sprinters generally do not have the quickness that smaller ones have in bursting out of the starting blocks .
Lewis was even slower than most in getting into high gear .
In a race as short and quick as the 100 meter dash a bad start could mean defeat for even the fastest sprinter .
Carl worked hard on his coach's instructions to stay low to the ground as he drove out of his starting blocks .
Once he had developed a respectable start . The rest was easy .
He only had to practice his sprinting form which has been called the smoothest in history .
Even his competitors marveled at how high he could lift his knees and how every muscle seemed to be under control .
In May 1983 when he roared through the 100 meters at Modesto California in 9.97 seconds , the fastest time ever recorded at sea level Carl served warning that world sprint records were no safer than long jump marks .
It might have been tempting for Lewis to stay with the 100 and the long jump and concentrate on breaking records .
But the legend of Jesse Owens and his 4 gold medals goaded him on to another event .
Besides winning the long jump and 100-meter dash in 1936 . Owens had also picked up first places in the 400 meter relay and the 200-yard dash .
The relay would be no problem for Carl his part would be almost identical to running a 100 meter race .
That left the 200-meter dash as Carl's final challenge .
If Lewis' dream of challenging Owens' mark had been a secret before that secret was spilled in June 1983 when he added the 200 to his schedule of events at the track Athletic Championship meet .
Carl had always run so effortlessly in the 100 that it seemed he might do well in the 200 .
The only questions were whether he could learn to sprint around a curve and if he had the endurance to finish strongly .
In just one race Carl answered all of those questions when he blazed to a United States' record of 19.75 , just off the world record of 19.72 set by Italy's Pietro Menne .
Only a foolish mistake by the inexperienced Lewis kept him from setting his first outdoor world record .
10 yards before the finish line a joyful Lewis realizing he would win the race threw up his hands in joy .
Veteran dash men pointed out that his early celebration slowed him down and might have cost him a 10th of a second .
Lee Evans , the retired world record holder at 400 meters told of how many races he had won in the last 3 or 4 meters .
He could not believe how often athletes would spoil years of preparation for a record by easing up before the end of a race .
In the same TAC meet Carl also won the long jump and the 100 meter dash .
In doing so , he became the first United States' athlete since 1886 to win the long jump and both sprints at a national championship mee .
Now that he had proven it was possible to run well in all of those events at a single meet all he needed to do before the 1984 Olympics was to test his overseas competition .
The chance came later that summer in the World Track and Field Championships at Helsinki , Finland .
There , Lewis discovered that his top competitors were all from the United States .
In Helsinki Lewis led a USA sweep of the top 3 places in both the long jump and the 100 meters .
Instead of taxing himself with the 200-meter run he chose to anchor that is run . The final leg of the 400 meter relay along with teammates Emmitt King Willie Gault and Calvin Smith Lewis sped along to a world record of 37.86 .
By this time Carl's fame had spread beyond the pages of track magazines and he was named Male Athlete of 1983 by The Associated Press .
While setting his sights on the 1984 Olympics in Los Angeles Carl took time to make another effort at overhauling Beamon's record .
In the Millrose Games at New York's Madison Square Garden in January 1984 . Carl , was suffering through one of his worst outings ever .
In 5 weak jumps the best he could manage was 27 feet 2.75in .
Seeing his chance to beat Lewis at last Larry Myricks flew 27 feet , 6 inches on his final try .
Carl , however , had one more chance .
This time he catapulted through the air for 28 feet 10.25in which broke his own indoor long jump record by over 9 inches .
Now it seemed just a matter of time before he would finally catch Beamo .
As the Olympics approached Lewis found the challenges on the track were easy compared to what he faced off the track .
Carl was not a natural celebrity .
While his outgoing sister enjoyed the social scene Carl a very private person had always held bac .
Carol once said she was the one who always tested new situations in life and then when she found out they were safe . She would bring Carl along .
Although Carol could do some impressive feats of her own and was considered the United States' best woman long jumper it was Carl who had to handle the publicity now .
As much as he wanted to . It was no longer possible to stay to himself and enjoy quiet hobbies such as collecting crystal .
He discovered just how little privacy he had when he received among many pieces of fan mail an overseas letter addressed only to Carl Lewis , USA .
Carl's business agent also made sure that his client's name stayed near the headlines .
It was he who declared that by the end of the Olympics . Lewis would be worth as much as multi millionaire singer Michael Jackso .
Such statements did not endear Lewis to the public .
The idea of track athletes planning to turn their records and medals into million dollar moneymaking schemes just did not fit the country's traditional idea of the modest dedicated sports hero .
Criticism , much of it cruel came from all directions .
Some writers even sneered at Lewis' ability and wondered when he didn't even own an individual outdoor world record .
The more that the press built Lewis up as King Carl and Superman IV , the more people expected of him .
Not many individuals can relax and have fun living up to a larger than life buildup and it was impossible for a shy private person such as Carl .
While Carl's agent planned to make him into a hot media star Carl was not acting like one .
He said he wanted to be known only as someone who was a nice guy and did his job in his own way .
Unfortunately for Carl . There was no way he could do things his own way and be considered a nice guy .
On the track Lewis often kept to himself when other athletes thought he should be more outgoing .
But it was his actions at the end of a race that disturbed competitors even more .
Besides , costing him a world record his habit of raising his arms in triumph before he hit the finish line seemed like hot-dogging to some .
So did his smiles of joy when he sometimes looked around to see how far behind his opponents were during the last meters of a race .
Those actions brought stinging criticism from the highly respected hurdler Edwin Moses , who thought Carl was rubbing it in and not showing respect for his opponents .
Lewis' chief rival in the long jump Larry Myricks confessed that his relationship with Carl was not the friendliest and that there would be some serious celebrating when Carl got beat .
Lewis argued that he wasn't intending to show off or belittle anyon .
When he was happy he couldn't help but show i .
But his competitors were not convinced by his arguments and Carl had to live with the criticism of not acting like a hero should .
Carl shrugged off all the controversy as best he could and geared up for the great Olympic challenge .
While many of the 1984 Olympic events were hurt by the absence of the boycotting athletes from the Soviet Union and their allies everyone admitted that the missing countries would have no effect on Carl's quest to match Owen's 4 gold medals .
None of the Eastern Bloc countries had an athlete who could come close to challenging for a gold medal in Carl's event .
As the experts pointed out the stiffest test on the way to the 4 golds would come well before the Olympics .
To win a spot on the Olympic team in each of his events Lewis would be going against the strongest sprinters and jumpers in the world . The United States' athletes .
By far the largest obstacle in Carl's way was the 100 meter dash at the United States' trials in Los Angeles in June 1984 .
The final race of the trials would possibly be the greatest collection of sprinters ever put together in one race and far more competitive than the Olympic final .
To get a chance to compete in the Olympic 100 Carl needed to finish in the Top 3 one tiny lapse could ruin his chance .
Carl must have been thinking hard about the race , because when he prepared to run one of the preliminary heats of the 100 he found he had not put on his shorts under his sweat pants .
After ducking into a stadium tunnel to slip on the shorts Carl earned a spot in the finals .
He had to wait while a friend nervously rushed to find Carl's uniform and get it to him in time .
The man had to wave from the stands to attract Lewis' attention when security officers refused to allow him onto the field .
Carl drew lane 2 for the final .
As he settled into his starting blocks . He was aware of the danger , his dream was in .
Calvin Smith , owner of the world record in this event . A 9.93 recorded at high altitude was to his left in lane one .
Brushing Carl's right shoulder was Emmit King , a member of the world record 400 meter relay team and the 1983 NCAA 100 meter champ .
The massive shoulders of Ron Brown filled lane 4 .
Brown had passed up a rich pro football contract with the Los Angeles Rams for a chance to run in the Olympics .
Lane 5 belonged to Mel Lattany , whose best time of 9.96 topped anything Carl had ever don .
Harvey Glance veteran of the 1976 Olympics crouched in lane  .
The last 2 lanes were given to the NCAA's most recent dash champions .
Kirk Baptiste the college 200-meter king seemed to be improving with every rac .
Sam Graddy , the NCAA 100 meter champ was out in lane 8 where he could sneak past Lewis without Carl ever seeing him .
Only 3 of these 8 record-holding sprinters would qualify for the Olympic 100 .
At the crack of the gun 8 pairs of legs churned into action .
Carl started well and stayed in the middle of the tightly packed wall of runners .
Gradually he pulled away from the field , clocking a 1006 time running into a win .
Graddy finished second and Brown edged the rest for 3rd place .
The competition had been so fierce that the world record holder Calvin Smith did not qualify for the Olympic 100 .
Carl's first place finish automatically gave him a spot on the 400 meter relay team and he had no problem in qualifying for the 200-meter dash or the long jump .
If he could stand up to the pressure of the Olympics and the grueling series of preliminary heats Lewis was almost certain to gain the heights that only Jesse Owens had reached .
In 19 36-22-year-old Jesse Owens had entered hostile territory .
The Olympics were being held in Berlin , Germany under the watchful eye of Nazi dictator Adolf Hitler .
The Games were to be a showcase for the Nazi claim that the European race was far superior to any other people in the world .
But it was a black athlete Owens , who dominated the events .
Jesse had taken advantage of teammate Ralph Metcalf s slow start to sprint to victory in the 100 meter dash .
Metcalf finished second to Owen's world record-tying 10.2 in the long jump . Jesse could easily have been unnerved by a misunderstanding .
He simply ran through the pit on his warm up , only to learn that the competition had actually begun .
When that attempt was declared a foul Owens started pulling himself together for a leap of 26 feet 5 inches .
Not only did that win the gold medal . It also stood as a world record for 25 years .
After that Owens had breezed to victory with an Olympic record in the 200 meters and a world record in the 200 meters and a world record in the 400-meter relay .
It was Carl Lewis' job to match that incredible speed and athletic talent .
Just as it had been in the Olympic trials , the 100-yard dash would be Carl's most difficult challenge .
It is difficult to relax when an instant's hesitation can drop a runner from first to last but Carl knew that the key to winning the race was in relaxing so his body could run smoothly .
After routinely working his way to the finals Carl stared down the track to his first gold medal 100 meters away .
This time he had drawn lane 7-2 lanes away from Sam Graddy his most dangerous medal threat .
Graddy settling into lane 5 seemed hot wired for quick starts .
He was fast enough so that Lewis could not afford to let him get too much of a lea .
As if to show his critics that he was still going to do things his way . Carl had come to Olympics wearing his hair in a very distinctive square brush cut .
He didn't need a special haircut to attract attention . However , as everyone in the stadium was watching Carl Lewi .
At the starter's signal the sprinters reared up for the start .
When the gun sounded Sam Graddy shot out of the blocks with the suddenness of a gust of wind , shattering a pane of glas .
Carl got off to a decent START but it was taking him some time to reach the speed of the shorter Graddy .
At the halfway point , he was still no better than 3rd .
To inexperienced spectators it looked as if Carl would lose .
But while other runners had reached top speed and were trying to hold it for the last 50 meters Lewis was still accelerating .
Graddy fought furiously to hold his lead and thought he might have a chance to win when Carl still had not caught him at 80 meters .
But then came the optical illusion Lewis shot by so quickly that it seemed he had reserved an extra kick for the end .
Actually , he had just maintained the tremendous speed he had finally built up to . While the other sprinters had begun to slow slightly .
Carl finished so strongly that his time of 9.99 was 0.2 of a second faster than the second place-Graddy , who had held off Canada's Ben Johnson , for the silver medal .
In a 100 meter race 0.2 of a second is a decisive margin of defeat .
It was not the usual Lewis expression of joy that fans saw at the end of the Race : Carl looked more like an outlaw who had just escaped from a close brush with a posse .
He seemed just plain relieved that the event was over .
Lewis put in his toughest day of Olympic work on August 6 , 1984 .
As he prepared for the long jump finals that evening he was starting to feel the effects of all the activity that day .
He had already run 2 heats of the 200-meter dash a tiring race for him in order to qualify for the semifinals .
He had also done the preliminary long jumps that had qualified him for the final .
Coach Tellez had been worried about this day .
Knowing how much long jumping saps an athlete's legs . He knew that Carl needed to qualify on his first jumps to ease the strain on his legs .
Fortunately Carl had done that .
Now a packed crowd was looking for Carl to shift his sights away from Jesse Owens and on to Bob Beamon's record .
Little did they know a tricky swirling wind and the hurried pace of Carl's day would make his effort futile .
Nevertheless , Lewis sped down the runway to give it his best shot .
Hitting his takeoff spot well he soared 28 feet 0.25 inch the second longest jump in Olympic history .
In that one brief instant the long jump competition was over .
Carl tried a second jump but stepped over the end of the board for a foul .
He would be allowed 4 more jumps .
But when he pulled on his sweat pants , he decided that he was probably through for the night .
His leg had felt a little sore after his second jump and the remembered his coach's warning about how taxing a single jump could b .
As he saw the competition falling far short of his mark he realized that conditions were far from ideal for breaking the record .
So knowing that he had probably clinched first place with his first jump . He passed his final attempts in order to save himself for the events that remained .
When the crowd realized what Carl was doing they began booing him .
They felt they had paid good money to see him at least try to reach Beamon's mark , but they had misjudged Carl's personality .
They had come to see Carl personality they had come to see Carl Lewis the entertainer .
But despite Carl's position as a star . He wasn't an entertainer .
Lewis was an athlete and he was after only one thing : 4 gold medals .
If there were world records to be set . He would deal with them later .
As it turned out , only one other Jumper came within a foot of Carl's first jump .
Now it was 2 gold medals down and 2 to go .
Lewis cruised through his semifinal heat of the 200-meter dash in an excellent time of 20.2 .
Based on the few times he had run the event , the 200 seemed to be Carl's best race .
Among track experts the only suspense in the race was whether or not he would break the world recor .
In the 200-meter dash runners begin by running on a curve of the track , and then finish on a straight awa .
Carl had been having some trouble getting a smooth relaxed stride on the curve portion of the race , and he wanted to master that problem in the finals .
As he bent down onto his starting blocks he made up his mind to do the best curve running of his lif .
Another United States' runner Thomas Jefferson got the best start in the race but Lewis quickly passed him .
Charging around the curve as he had never done before . Carl had already stretched out to a comfortable lead when he reached the straight away .
Since Carl's finish had always been the best part of his race , its start had nearly been a fatal mistake and Carl was glad he had not spent any more of his energy back in the long jump pit .
It would have been better show business if Carl had been pushed by tough competition when he tried to win the medal that would link him forever with Jesse Owens .
But everyone knew the 400 meter relay was going to be a breeze for the US team .
After all , it was almost certain that 4 of the 5 fastest men in the race would be running for the USA .
Even if they had sloppy baton exchanges Carl and his teammates would still win .
Only a dropped baton could beat them .
From his spot on the far curve of the track Lewis watched his teammates carry his gold medal hopes in their hands . While there hopes in their hands .
While there wasn't a chance of them being outsprinted his medal wouldn't be safe until he could feel the baton firmly in he could feel the baton firmly in his fingers .
Sam Graddy led off and raced around the first curve toward Ron Brown .
Brown then pounded down the backstretch and handed off to Calvin Smith .
As he zeroed in on Lewis Smith opened up a large lea .
None of the hand-offs were perfect and Lewis made the risky move of switching the baton from one hand to the other during his RUN but the exchanges do their work .
Carl Lewis flew across the finish line in a time of 37.83 .
The 4 gold medals were now his and it was especially satisfying to cap his pursuit of the Jesse Owen's legend with a world record time in the relay .
After such a stunning achievement , one might have expected Lewis to retire from competition .
Instead , Carl set his sights on the 1988 Olympics .
There Carl would attempt an extraordinary feat to repeat his 4 gold medals performance of 198 .
Carl's dream ended abruptly in the 100 meter dash .
Canada's Ben Johnson exploded out of the blocks and finished first in an astounding 9.79 , second .
But Carl took the gold in the long jump with his 56th win in a row in that even .
The next day . International Olympic Committee officials announced that illegal steroids had been found in Ben Johnson's post race drug test .
Johnson's gold medal was stripped from him and given to second place . Lewis .
Suddenly the dream of 4 gold medals flickered anew .
But Lewis finished second in the 200-meter das .
And the US 400 meter relay team botched a baton pass in the semi-finals and was disqualified .
Carl had failed to repeat his 1,984 Olympic performance but no athlete could feel disappointed about winning 2 gold medals and one silver in any Olympic Games .
And Carl had actually improved on his 1,984 Olympic marks in all 3 events .
Bob Beamon's longstanding record in the long jump of 29 feet 2.5in , was broken . Finally , in 1991 , but not by Carl Lewis .
At the world track and field championships in Tokyo on August 30 , 1991 Lewis top score of the day was an impressive 29-feet , 1.25in against the win .
Although this jump was the best Carl had ever made in competition . Up to that point , it was not good enough to break the new world record set that day by fellow American Mike Powel .
Powell had jumped 29-feet , 4.25i .
In spite of this obvious disappointment Lewis was enthusiastic about his performance at the World Championships .
He had set a new world record in the 100 meters at 9.86 seconds . 5 days before the long jump competition and participated in the record-breaking win of the US team in the 400 meter relay with a time of 37.5 second .
In his own words greatest meet I never had .
What's ahead for Carl Lewis , now that the old long jump record has been broken .
With his self-confidence and determination still intact . He confided to a reporter for 10 years , 29 feet has been my goa .
So now it's 9 meter .
This talented athlete is still chasing legends and is well on his way to becoming a legend himself .
Formal athletics events include 2 groups track and field .
The track events are those that require speed against other athletes while in the field events the athletes compete at a time in jumping or throwing trials .
Events on the track , can be divided into several sections .
On the flat there are sprints middle distance races and long distance races . There are also the 4 by 100m relay and the 4 by 400m relay .
In addition , races are run over hurdles and barriers from 110m up to 3,000 .
Extreme distance races include the marathon , over 42 kilometers and the men's 50km road walk .
Events in the field can be divided into 2 sections , jumping and throwing .
Jumping events include the high jump , long jump triple jump and pole vault .
Throwing events comprise the javelin discus hammer and shot put .
Whereas track races are measured by time accurate to one-hundredth of a second field events are measured by distance or height in meters .
Every athlete is allowed 3 attempts to achieve a qualifying distance or height . If he is successful he progresses to the next round .
Olympic hurdle events are the 110m , the 400m and the 30 ohm steeplechase the steeplechase consists of hurdles and water jumps the hurdles for this event are more robust than the others and the runners can either step onto them or jump them .
The race walks generally take place on roads , rather than on the formal track .
The main characteristic of walking is that the runner's front foot must touch the ground before he lifts his rear foot .
Olympic race walks are the 20km and 50km for men and 10km for women .
The decathlon is a 2-day contest for men and comprises 100m long jump high jump shot 400m , 110m hurdles discus pole vault javelin and 1,500m .
The heptathlon is a contest for women and consists of 100m 100m hurdles shot javelin high jump , long jump and 800m .
Can sit-ups help reduce the bulge in my stomach .
My friends say that sit-ups work . Is this true .
No .
They will strengthen the muscles underneath the fat , but you won't lose any more fat there than you will on the rest of your body .
If you want to lose a significant amount of fat . The best way is through aerobic exercise , such as running biking and swimming , which will help you burn off fat all over the body including the stomac .
The English are passionate lovers of competitive sports and when they are neither playing nor watching games they like to talk about them or when they cannot do that to think about them .
The game peculiarly associated with England is cricket .
Many other games too are English in origin but have been popularly adopted in other countries . But cricket has been extensively adopted only in the Commonwealth , particularly in Australia , India , Pakistan and the West Indies .
Nearly every village in England except in far north has its cricket club .
A first-class match lasts for up to 3 days with 6 hours' play on each afternoon .
Cricket makes no progress in popularity .
For the majority of the British public the 8 months of the football season are more important than the 4 months of cricket .
Professional football is always a big business every town has at least one professional football club .
The players have not necessarily any personal connection with the town for whose team they play they are bought and sold between the clubs .
The cup final , which is played in May . Each year in London is the greatest event of the seaso .
Rugby , football is played with an egg-shaped Ball , it can be a dangerous game as players wear no protective clothing .
This form of sport got its name because it originated from the famous rugby public school .
There is some professional league rugby in the north , but elsewhere rugby union is mainly played by amateurs and favored by the middle class .
It is also the game played at the great majority of public schools .
Most secondary schools have playing fields and boys usually play rugby or soccer in winter and cricket in summer as a normal school Activity while schoolgirls play tennis and a sort of baseball in summer and netball and hockey in winter .
Men's basketball is almost unknown .
The more social adult games of golf and tennis are played by great numbers of people .
Golf courses are also meeting places of the business community . It is for example very desirable for bank managers to play golf .
Moreover , there are plenty of tennis clubs every town provides numerous tennis courts in public parks and anyone can play tennis cheaply .
Next to Association Football The chief spectator sport in English life is horse racin .
Partly because of the laws which forbid such activities on Sundays . Horse racing is organized rather differently in England from other countries .
Their horse racing mainly takes place on working days and during working hours .
The whole atmosphere of a race meeting still belongs in some ways to the 18th century with old divisions between upper and lower people .
Every day people all over the country . Bet on the day's race .
Although the British are so fond of watching horses racing . They are not very interested in being spectators at occasions when human beings race togethe .
Although athletic sports and gymnastics are practiced at school few towns have running tracks for public use .
Remarkably few people are interested in bicycle racing .
On the other hand , rowing in fours or eights occupies a leading place in the sporting life of schools and universities which have suitable water Nearby it is watched from the river banks by vast crowds of spectators .
When English people use the word hunting they usually mean fox hunting a sport , which is popular among a small but important minority .
There are many people who would like to see fox hunting forbidden by law on the ground that it is cruel , but there is little possibility that this will be done .
Americans use the word hunting to include the shooting of birds but the English do not .
The moorlands of the north and of Scotland are rich in grouse and partridge and to go shooting on the moors is perhaps the most distinctive of upper class activities .
The opening of shooting season on August 12 attracts many top people on the moors they pay enormous amounts for their pleasure .
Being afraid of losing votes . Modern leaders do not shoot or if they do they try their best to avoid the photographers .
Britain was the first home of many of the modern world's most popular sport .
The English can not claim today that they have surpassing skill in any form of sport when they engage in international competition but they care strongly about the sporting spirit the capacity to play with respect for the rules and the opponents to win with modesty and to lose with good temper .
A love of sport has been characteristic in Highlands and Lowlands alike . It is inherent in the Scottish characte .
Of all the games played in Scotland . In days gone by 3 stand out as claiming Scottish origin and being particularly Scottish in character golf curling and shinty and of these golf has now achieved worldwide popularity .
The best country for golf is a large expanse of uncultivated soil not too much broken up by hills and in Scotland . The links particularly along the east coast form ideal ground .
Of all Scottish golfing centers St Andrews is the shrine of golfing tradition .
There is much evidence , however , that the kings and queens of Scotland themselves shared their people's enthusiasm for playing games .
Mary Queen of Scots , was accused by her enemies of playing golf shortly after her husbands' murder .
And the years before 1,857 have been described as the golden age of private golf matches for it saw the first championships inaugurated at the initiative of the Prestwick Golf Club in SCOTLAND It began with a letter addressed by the Prestwick Golf Club to 7 leading clubs proposing that each club should nominate 4 players for a golf match The last victorious pair should be declared champions and the prize , be a medal or a piece of plate .
The response was enthusiastic this began the English Amateur Golf Championship now restricted to players born in England , the Channel Islands and the sons of parents born in these place .
Curling is a game played on a sheet of ic .
This sport is believed to have sprung from Holland just over 4 centuries ago but Scotland has been its real home since the early part of the 17th century .
In principle the game very much resembles bowls but curling is played with heavy flat stones to slide along the ice .
The oldest curling stone found in Scotland bears the date of 151 .
The game is often referred to as the roaring game because of the sound resulting from the stone speeding alon .
Like golf curling can claim to be both Royal ancien .
Tradition has it that the Stuart kings were curlers and both Mary Queen of Scots and Darnley are reputed to have played .
Like golf it too has won popularity outside Scotland although to lesser extent and there are curling clubs in England , Canada , New Zealand , Russia and Switzerland .
Now curling stones are cut from hard rock rounded and polished and fitted with a wooden handl .
Among games less widely popular but still played with great enthusiasm . Shinty is one of the most traditional .
Played with a ball made of cork and leather and a wooden club . It used to be popular amongst all ages particularly round about the season of Christmas but now is usually indulged in only by the more youthful members of the community .
In the old days , it was the custom for local parishes to engage each other in this game and the prize . According to one tradition a keg of genuine Mountain Dew was attractive for Highland whisky was appreciated no less than today .
Shinty is a fine free game , much less restricted by rules but otherwise not unlike hockey which is derived from it .
In old times a field of shinty must have resembled a battleground its usual accompaniment being skirling pipes and waving banners .
Today the pipes still play a picturesque part marching their teams on to the field of play and hailing their victories with piercing blasts of triumph .
In relation to population Australia holds an outstanding international position in sport , its champions have been many and varied and there is hardly a popular sport in which Australia has not gained recognition .
The most likely explanation for this sporting preeminence seems to lie not in any single reason , but in a combination of factor .
Natural ability is an important consideration as is the opportunity that potential champions have to develop in their particular fields through widespread clubs , state and national competitions .
Many Australian youngsters of both sexes begin playing regular competitive sports at the early age of 8 or under , thousands of youngsters can be seen each weekend joining in football , cricket , tennis hockey basketball and swimming competitions .
Sport also plays an important part in school life where a half day a week is usually set aside for inter school competitions spectator sports like horse racing , football , cricket , tennis and car racing draw big crowds .
And public interest in stimulated by extensive television newspaper and radio coverage .
A distinctively Australian contribution is the volunteer surf lifesaving movement which keeps a constant vigil over swimmers in the sur .
Thousands of young men all excellent swimmers belong to these clubs at most surfing beache .
The spectacular surf carnivals when the lifesavers compete against each other in special surf events are an outstanding feature of the Australian summer scene .
Other popular water sports are swimming in constructed pools and inland waters yachting and sailing surfboard riding water skiing skin diving motor boat racing and fishing including big game beach and rock fishing and freshwater angling .
In winter snow sports in the Australian Alps have become popular and facilities in the snowfields have developed rapidly in recent years to keep pace with increasing demand .
Growing numbers of top overseas skiers and instructors are coming to the Australian Snow Resorts during the northern hemisphere summer .
There are 4 main codes of footbal .
Australian rules a fast open and rugged game played with 18 men a side on a large oval field is the chief code in 4 of the 6 states .
Rugby league and rugby union are the most popular codes in New South Wales and Queensland while soccer is played in all states , mainly by migrants and is growing in popularity .
Other popular sports include men's and women's field hockey basketball squash and athletics .
There are also many devotees of baseball and softball table tennis and rifle shooting boxing wrestling judo archery rowing fencing gymnastics 10 pin bowling .
All forms of horse riding are popular from pony clubs to polo and Olympic equestrian style events .
The premier turf event is the Melbourne Cup held at Flemington Racecourse in november . It is a public holiday in the Melbourne metropolitan area and the focus of national betting interest .
The Olympic Games are the oldest international amateur sporting contest in the WORLD held every 4 years , the games supposedly developed from ancient Greek athletic contests in honor of a god or dead hero .
The original sole event was a 210 yard race held in 776 BC in Olympia in honor of Zeus later additional events such as boxing wrestling long jumping discus and javelin throwing distance running and chariot Racing were added .
The games at Olympia lasted 7 days .
The games lost popularity . However , largely due to the growth of cheating and were abolished by Emperor Theodosius I in 394 AD .
In 1896 the first modern Olympic games were held in Athens organized by a Frenchman Pierre de Coubertin .
Since then , the Games have been held in different cities . Once every 4 years , except in 1916 , 1,940 and 1,944 .
In 1924 . The Winter Olympics were started at chamois , Franc .
There is no age limit for competitors . Unless one has been established by a sport's international federation no discrimination is allowed on grounds of race , religion or political affiliation .
The Games are contests between individuals and not between countries .
In 1986 . The IOC voted to alternate the Summer and Winter Games every 2 years beginning in 1994 .
The Winter Games would be held in 1992 and again in 1994 and thereafter would be held every 4 years the summer Games would maintain their original 4-year cycle .
The maximum numbers of entries permitted for individual events is 3 per nation The number is fixed by the IOC , in consultation with the international federation concerne .
In team events . Only one team per country is allowe .
The IOC is the supreme authority responsible for policy making . Regarding the Olympic movement and the spread of modern Olympic .
It was founded in 1894 by Pierre de Coubertin .
The IOC recognizes one National Olympic Committee , for each country .
Lausanne was chosen as the site for the IOC headquarters in 1913 .
Members of the Executive Board sit for 4-year terms , the president is elected for 8 years and is expected to serve as the leading , spokesman for the Olympic Movement .
7 men have held this post .
The form of the opening ceremony is laid down by the IOC , in great detail . From the moment when the chief of state of the host country is received by the president of the IOC and the organizing committee at the entrance to the stadium to the end of the proceedings when the last team files out .
When the head of state has reached his place in the tribune he is greeted with the national anthem of his country and the parade of competitors begins .
The Greek team is always the first to enter the stadium and except for the host team which is always last the other nations follow in alphabetical order as determined by the language of the organizing country .
Each contingent dressed in its official uniform is preceded by a shield with the name of its country while an athlete carries its national flag .
The competitors march around the stadium and then form up in the center of the ground facing the Tribun .
The president of the organizing committee then delivers a brief speech of welcome followed by another brief speech from the President of the IOC who asks the chief of state to proclaim the Games ope .
The Olympic hymn is sounded as the Olympic flag is slowly raised pigeons are released symbolically to fly to the countries of the world with the news that the Games are open .
The Olympic flame is then carried into the stadium by the last of the runners who have brought it from Olympia Greece The Runner circles the track mounts the steps and lights the Olympic fire that burns night and day during the games .
The Closing Ceremony takes place after the final event .
Since the Melbourne Olympics in 1956 and after certain formalities have been observed the athletes taking part stage their own demonstrations .
The ceremonies include a parade of athletes 6 from each nation marching 8 or 10 abreast without distinction of nationality signifying the friendly bonds of Olympic sport .
The president of the IOC calls the youth of the world to assemble in 4 years to celebrate the Games of the next Olympia .
A fanfare is sounded the Olympic fire is extinguished and to the strains of the Olympic hymn the Olympic flag is lowered and the Games are over .
In the stadium and its immediate surroundings , the Olympic flag is flown freely together with the flags of the nations taking part .
The Olympic flag presented by Baron Coubertin in 1914 is the prototype . It has a white background and in the center . There are 5 interlaced rings blue , yellow-black , green and RED The blue ring is on the left , next to the pole .
These rings represent the 5 continents joined together in the Olympic movement .
The Olympic hymn plays as the flag of the IOC is raised The music was composed by Spirou Samara , the words were added by costs Palmas 1,896 Greece .
